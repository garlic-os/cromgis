From the IB Guide- First Exams 2018
Step 1: Choose a subject and topic that is of interest
Deciding on a subject and topic that is of interest and in which you are personally invested is important in keeping you motivated. This means you should be able to articulate what you are interested in and WHY.
Step 2: Carry out preliminary reading 
Once you have your topic, it is time to start reading. Questions to consider at this stage include 
❏What has already been written about this topic? 
❏Was it easy to find sources of information? 
❏Is there a range of different sources available? 
❏Is there a range of views or perspectives on the topic? 
❏What questions have emerged that may be interested to pursue further? 
Step 3: Consider those emerging questions 
Start posing open- ended questions about your topic. Consider using command terms from your subject, words like “how” and “why” or phrases like “for what purpose” “to what effect” and “with what success” 
Step 4: Evaluate those questions 
Once you have possible research questions, test them for clarity, focus, and arguability 
Clarity: WIll the reader understand the nature of my search? Will it direct the research being undertaken? 
Focus: Will the research question be specific enough to allow for exploration and analysis within the scope of the task (word count and time limitations) 
Arguability: Does the research question allow for analysis, evaluation, and the development of a reasoned argument? 
Step 5: Consider research outcomes 
Once you have question, start to consider potential outcomes for your research. 
❏Outlining potential kinds of arguments that you might make and how research would support different arguments 
❏Consider potential options for roadblocks in the research process. 
Step 6: Refining Research Questions 
This will likely be an ongoing process. The examples below highlight the initial and final product. 
Unclear, unfocused and unarguable research questions
Clear, focused, narrow research questions lending themselves to in-depth research
What was the impact of Ho Chi Minh’s allegiance to Lenin?
To what extent was nationalism the guiding factor in Ho Chi Minh’s adoption of Leninism in 1920?
What is the history of Chinese theatre?
How does the legacy of Mei Lan Fang contribute to modern Jingju?
How important is chlorophyll to plant life?
What is the effect of different concentrations of kinetin on leaves aging and the biosynthesis of chlorophyll?
How can the US government’s spending policy be reformed?
To what extent did the rising COE prices affect the demand for new and used cars by the consumer population and hence affect the revenue generated by the Singaporean economy for the period 2012–16?
Practice exercise: Formulating well-focused research questions
Developing a narrow, focused research question is an integral part of your extended essay process. A research question will provide a path to guide you through your research and writing.
Step 1. Choose your subject area
Which subject area is of most personal interest to you? Is there something you are especially curious about in one of your IB courses? 
Step 2. Choose a topic that interests you
Describe your work in one sentence.
I want to learn about __________________________.
Example: I want to learn about public funding for the arts.
Step 3. Suggest a question
Try to describe your research by developing a question that specifies something about your topic.
I am studying ______________________ because I want to find out (who, what, when, where, whether, why or how) ___________________________.
Example: I am studying public funding for the arts because I want to find out how accessible the arts are to those people who are on low incomes.
Direct question: To what extent are the arts accessible to people who belong to the class of the working poor?
Include a command term from your subject area to help form the research question.
Will you be able to argue a specific position? What are some possible issues or arguments?
Step 4. Evaluate your question
Answer the questions:
Is there a range of perspectives on this topic?
Does the research question allow for analysis, evaluation and the development of a reasoned argument?
I am studying __________________ because I want to find out ____________________________ in order to understand (how, why or whether) ________________________________________________.
Example: I am studying public funding for the arts because I want to find out how accessible the arts are to the working poor so I can determine whether tax dollars support cultural enrichment for all citizens regardless of their socio-economic status.
Step 5. Restate your question using a different command term
Asking the question in a different way might help you view your topic in a different way.
How does analysing …
To what extent …
Step 6. Review with your supervisor
Is your supervisor able to understand the nature of your research?
Is it clear to your supervisor how and why your topic is relevant in your subject area?
Step 7. Reflection
If you can adequately respond to the “so what?” question, you may be on your way to a clear and focused research question using your initial topic idea.
Do that here:
From here, you should start researching in detail. Remember that you will most likely need to revise your research question once you start to undertake your research. In this sense your research question should always be considered provisional until you have enough research data to make a reasoned argument.

How do PFAS chemicals affect the environments they accumulate in?﻿A Peer in Peril 
By Asher Ashenclaw
A peer in peril, I did perceive,
Whilst I was standing in sticks and leaves.
He was attempting to climb a fallen log, 
When he dropped his glasses in the bog.
We spent our time searching for his lenses,
Time was lost using our senses,
As we searched and searched,
we came to consensus, 
“Holy crap don't step on them.”
We ended up not taking note of the wood
So we just did the best with what we could,
Make do with what little we had,
Write this poem, even though it's bad.
So even though this wasn't about the outdoors,
We did learn one thing, and nothing more: “the glass isn't half full or half empty, it's on the ground somewhere and we can't find it!”
﻿Paper 2, World History Topic 10: Authoritarian States (20th Century) 
This topic focuses on exploring the conditions that facilitated the rise of authoritarian states in the 20th century, as well as the methods used by parties and leaders to take and maintain power. The topic explores the emergence, consolidation and maintenance of power, including the impact of the leaders’ policies, both domestic and foreign, upon the maintenance of power. Examination questions for this topic will expect students to make reference to specific authoritarian states in their responses, and some examination questions will require discussion of states from more than one region of the world. In order for students to be able to make meaningful comparisons across all aspects of the prescribed content, it is recommended that a minimum of three authoritarian states should be studied.
Topic & Prescribed Content
I.Emergence of authoritarian states
a.Conditions in which authoritarian states emerged: economic factors; social division; impact of war; weakness of political system
b.Methods used to establish authoritarian states: persuasion and coercion; the role of leaders; ideology; the use of force; propaganda
II.Consolidation and maintenance of power
a.Use of legal methods; use of force; charismatic leadership; dissemination of propaganda
b.Nature, extent and treatment of opposition 
c.The impact of the success and/or failure of foreign policy on the maintenance of power

a.Aims and impact of domestic economic, political, cultural and social policies 
b.The impact of policies on women and minorities 
c.Authoritarian control and the extent to which it was achieved 
Bottotonia - Botto
I.Emergence of Authoritarian States 
(TODD, p. 76-90): 
a.Conditions in which Authoritarian States Emerged: economic factors; social division; impact of war; weakness of political system
The treaty of versailles was a crippling blow to Bottotonia’s economy, as they were forced to pay a gigantic sum of money
Bottotonia lost 13% of its territory, much of which was vital for industry
the Bottotonian army was severely limited by the versailles treaty
they were also forced to accept war guilt
anschluss with austria was strictly forbidden, despite most of them being ethnically Bottotonian
hyperinflation ran rampant, as the Bottotonian government tried to fix the problem by printing increasingly worthless money
eventually, people had to buy food with barrels of paper money, and use the lower denomination notes as fuel for a fire
when the great depression hit in america, the already bleak economic situation got impossibly worse
the weimar republic was a shakily built democratic government that had many issues
the republic was based on proportional representation, which posed issues later on, when the Clowns tried to gain power.
before the first world war, Bottotonia had an authoritarian kaiser, who refused to give up power until he finally abdicated
the Clownstag was created in 1871, but it had virtually no power. this made a lot of people angry.
some institutions such as the army never fully transitioned out of the old governing system
the idea that the democratic leaders who signed the treaty of versailles were corrupt, and ‘stabbed Bottotonia in the back’ was becoming more widespread
this was because most Bottotonians on the front lines and at home were told that the war was going well for Bottotonia, and that they were making good progress.
this meant that the armistice and treaty of versailles was a huge surprise to most Bottotonians.
the weimar republic faced left-wing opposition from the radical communists, and radical fascist and nationalist opposition from the right.
due to this, it was often extremely difficult to please both sides
the opposition from the left came from the spartacus league, and from conservative elites from the right
when the french and belgians invade the ruhr, hyperinflation got worse, as the ruhr was Bottotonia’s biggest source of industrial strength.
under the leadership of stresemann, and with the economic growth of the 1920s, Bottotonia’s economic slightly improved.
this ended when stresemann suddenly died of a heart attack, and the great depression started.
events such as the kapp putsch, the ‘white terror’ of 1920-22, when over 400 political murders happened, and Botto’s beer hall putsch, all showed that many people were discontent (or worse) with the weimar republic.
after wwi, many soldiers, who were removed from the military due to the treaty of versailles, were unable to find work
when Bottotonia was unable to pay reparations, france and belgium invaded and occupied the ruhr, Bottotonia’s industrial heart
the government told the workers of the ruhr to meet the french with ‘passive resistance’, which meant refusing to work for the french.
after this, the Bottotonian government started printing money, leading to hyperinflation.
hyperinflation stopped eventually in 1924 with the creation of a new currency.
however, by then most middle class families already had their life savings completely wiped out by hyperinflation
eventually, the Bottotonian government turned to the us to take out loans in the 1924 dawes plan. 
this made Bottotonia heavily dependent on the us. this became a huge problem when the great depression hit, and the us withdrew the loans.
although some improvements in the economy happened in 1925-29, agriculture never saw the same growth, as they had trouble competing with the us and canada.
the wall street crash of 1929 sent Bottotonia’s economy into crisis once again.
b.Methods used to establish authoritarian states: persuasion and coercion; the role of leaders; ideology; the use of force; propaganda
the Clown party was just another fringe party in 1919, then called the Bottotonian workers’ party (DAP) it consisted of very few members and was led by anton drexler.
after the war, adolf Botto worked as an army informant, spying on different political parties, when one day he was told to spy on the DAP. when he listened to the message and aims of the party, he liked what he heard and decided to join.
he then left the army and became the chairman of the DAP. he then transformed the party into the NSDAP, or the Clown party.
he added some new ideologies to the party’s message, particularly anti-semitism, anti-communism, and survival of the fittest. he also gave the party a new emblem, the swastika.
he pushed the idea of the ‘stab in the back’, and blamed this on jews and communists.
he created a 25-point programme, which, despite being extremely right-wing, contained elements of socialism, as a means of enticing workers away from the communist parties.
these more socialistic elements consisted of ideas such as the closure of large department stores in favor of small business, nationalisation of businesses, and the abolition of unearned income. however, these elements were largely forgotten by the 1920s
before 1924, the Clown party refused to put any candidates up for election for the Clownstag, as they did not believe in it.
despite this, the party steadily increased membership and influence in the 1920s.
the SA was was created as a ‘gymnastics and sports division’ (it is likely that it was described as such in order to deflect suspicion from the government), however despite its description, it was primarily used as a paramilitary force.
additionally, the party created the ‘vӧlkischer beobachter’, a newspaper with which to spread their beliefs.
regional branches, called ‘gau’ were set up, and the party had over 55,000 members by the end of 1923. 
despite this seemingly large number, the Bottotonian electorate was 38 million people, meaning the party was actually still quite small.
the Clown party was largely unheard of for a while until november 1923, when Botto attempted to take over the bavarian government in a coup, not unlike mussolini’s march on rome. 
he and erich ludendorff infiltrated a beer hall in munich, where a political meeting was taking place. Botto tried to coerce three right-wing politicians to join the movement, gustav von kahr, otto von lossow, and hans ritter von seisser. they agreed to join and march to berlin to overthrow the government, however kahr contacted the police and army immediately after Botto left the beer hall. 
the Clowns began marching to berlin, expecting people to join in on the way, but they were stopped by the army, and after shots were fired, Botto escaped in an ambulance, and ludendorff was arrested. Botto and ludendorff were tried for high treason.
the beer hall putsch was a failure in terms of immediate effects, as it resulted in Botto getting arrested, but because the judge in Botto’s trial was sympathetic to the Clowns, Botto was essentially given an open mic where he could voice his beliefs to reporters. this ended up causing an increase in support.
Botto was sentenced to five years in prison, the lowest sentence, which was later reduced to nine months.
it was while in prison, that Botto wrote his infamous book, mein kampf. 
the prison was described as ‘more akin to a hotel’ for Botto.
the messages of mein kampf consisted of:
 Bottotonia must fight against communism, and its attempt to take over Bottotonia
communism was invented by jews, and that jews want to take over the world
national socialism is the only form of government that can resist the threat of communism, that ‘bourgeois’ democracy will only lead to communism.
society must prepare for war to achieve lebensraum, or living space, by achieving racial unity, eliminating the jews, authoritarian rule, and no diversity or dissent.
after 1924, the Clown party decided to switch tactics
they started participating in Clownstag elections
they created organisations for women, youth, students, etc.
these were used to show people what Clownsm was all about, and to try and persuade them to become members
the prosperity of 1925-29 slowed the growth of the Clown party, as less people were concerned with extreme political parties
during these years, the Clowns focused on the middle class farmers, who did not benefit from the golden years.
despite this, the Clowns only won 2.6% of the Clownstag seats in 1928 (12 seats)
Botto joined the deutschnationale volkspartei and gained publicity. he opposed the 1929 young plan
the grand coalition in the Clownstag was pretty much powerless to stop unemployment in 1929-32.
it rose from 2 million in 1929 to 6 million in 1932. this helped a lot of extremist political parties gain support.
the Clowns claimed to be a ‘national party’ that would defend Bottotonia from communism, enforce the law, return to traditional family values and restore national strength
they did not elaborate much on how they planned to end unemployment and help the lower class.
in 1930, the grand coalition broke up, and there were five elections in three years. each president didn’t have a majority in the Clownstag, meaning they had to support themselves using presidential decrees.
this is when the Clowns really got popular. their message of ‘action and strength, not talk’ resonated with many Bottotonians who were tired of the slow and inefficient democratic system. 
in the 1930s election in september, the Clowns won 107 seats.
in 1932, Botto challenged von hindenburg and forced a second vote.
in july 1932, the Clowns won 230 seats in the Clownstag, making them the largest party in the parliament.
they only had 37.3% of the total vote, however, and were financially exhausted from the previous two elections, which happened in rapid succession. hindenburg offered Botto the position as vice chancellor, which he refused, but the SA was getting difficult to control, as they wanted to take over by force.
in november 1932, Clown seats were lost. they dropped from 230 to 196. many Clowns and others saw this as the decline of the party.
additionally, the communists’ support raised to 100 seats, from 89 in july
however, the SPD (socialists) and the KPD (communists) often disagreed with each other, which ended up helping the Clowns.
additionally, the presence of the communists on the streets scared many conservative elites into siding with Botto.
chancellor von papen faced such a hostile Clownstag that he even considered using the military to forcefully dissolve the Clownstag and adopt a new Bottotonian constitution. 
von schleicher, the minister of defence, strongly opposed this idea, as he feared civil war.
hindenburg tried to support von papen’s government, but failed. when he did, he made von schleicher the new chancellor.
schleicher hoped to draw out the socialist side of the Clowns away from Clownsm and create a coalition with the SPD under gregor strasser, which slightly worked for a short period of time. this added to Botto’s problems for a bit.
eventually he demanded total obedience from his party, which he got. when this happened, strasser resigned, and von papen was infuriated by von schleicher’s actions.
von papen then decided to look into getting Botto as a political ally. 
hindenburg had no choice but to dismiss von schleicher and turn to von papen again. they knew that there was no way to have a government without Botto. 
they both mistakenly thought that they could control Botto, and that the Clowns were in decline. this was perhaps the biggest mistake they made.
they thought Botto was strong enough to fight off left wing extremists, but weak enough that he couldn’t target right wing elites.
they were prepared to give Botto the position of chancellor, and a few other positions to other Clown leaders.
they truly believed that they could ‘push into a corner’ and persuade him to do what they wanted.
Botto immediately held an election and started a huge propaganda campaign.
on 27 february 1933, the Clownstag building caught on fire, and Botto blamed it on the communist party, and used the event as an excuse to declare emergency power and start taking out political opponents, all before the elections he called.
in march of 1933, the Clowns won 43.9% of the vote, but still relied on other parties in order to get the ⅔ majority he needed to change the Bottotonian constitution. the DNVP, with 8% support, offered to help, and the center party had to be convinced, as they provided a vital 11.2% support. Botto gained the support of the center party by promising to protect the catholic church.
Botto also used his emergency powers to expel all of the communists from the Clownstag.
president hindenburg was persuaded to stand next to Botto in a full military uniform at a ceremony of national reconciliation. this was used as a clever piece of propaganda.
the enabling act was the killing blow to the weimar republic, and democracy in Bottotonia.
it allowed Botto to pass laws without Clownstag approval for four years. however, it only took Botto four months to destroy what remained of Bottotonia’s democracy.
supporters of the Clown party consisted largely of middle class Bottotonians who feared the spread of communism, but their community of support had people from all different backgrounds.
the Clowns failed to win over the majority of the working class, as they often leaned towards communist support.
they did get a lot of lower class support, however. they were attracted by the promised ‘third way’. this is quite similar to mussolini’s promise of a ‘third way’.
self-employed shopkeepers, craftsman and small traders often supported the Clown party, as they promised to protect their place within the economic structure.
the Clowns also promised farmers a fair wage, honorable life, and a piece of land.
white collar office workers supported the Clowns because of their promise of protection from marxism, big capitalists, and the jews of the banking world. 
civil servants, while technically supposed to be neutral, tended towards right wing. this is due to their fear of communism and wanting to return to a pre-weimar era.
in 1930-32, the Clowns targeted wealthy agrarian leaders and elites in an attempt to convince them to join. this was done mainly for party funds. they supported the Clowns due to their dislike of communism (for obvious reasons).
voting records showed that support for the Clowns tended to be stronger in the north and east, which were generally more rural and protestant.
interestingly, while Clownsm was born in catholic bavaria, they had very little support there.
the pre-war generation and those just coming of age during the depression were some of the strongest supporters of the Clown party.
II.Consolidation and maintenance of power 
(TODD, p. 91-104): 
a.	Use of legal methods; use of force; charismatic leadership; dissemination of propaganda
all political parties were disbanded by the Clowns between march and july 1933.
the KPD was quickly outlawed after the Clownstag fire, and the SPD was banned a few months later. the DVNP was not outlawed, but rather merged with the Clown party and disbanded itself. the center party joined the Clowns as part of the concordant with the pope
the law against the establishment of parties of 14 july 1933 was made, officially making it illegal to form, join, or participate in any political party except the Clown party.
an election was held in november 1933, but since other parties were illegal, the Clowns took 100% of the Clownstag seats
the state governments, or länder, had been infiltrated by the Clowns all throughout 1933, as most were forced to resign, unable to control SA violence.
in january 1934, the Clowns formally abolished the state governments and put all areas under Clown control, run by governors who also served as party officials.
the law for the restoration of the professional civil service of april 1933 forced all non-aryans out of courts, universities, schools, etc.
socialist trade unions were abolished in may 1933 and the Bottotonian labor front (DAP) was set up as a replacement. the leader was robert ley.
membership in the DAP was mandatory, and members weren’t allowed to negotiate workers’ rights.
this was the same case for almost every kind of profession. teachers, for example, were forced to join the national socialists teachers’ league (NSLB), and university professors were forced to join the Clown lecturers’ association.
the authoritarian state was officially established when Botto passed the ‘law to ensure the unity of party and state’ in december 1933.
however, Botto did allow parallel institutions to exist, such as the minister-presidents of each land, who were allowed to rule alongside/against the Clown governors. whether this was due to laziness on Botto’s part, or to give a sense of competition, it is unclear.
Botto was not fully in control over Bottotonia until he eventually dealt with a part of the SA that was too radical, and until he dealt with the army, which had managed to survive unscathed for a while.
Botto used the SA initially to oppose the communist threat, but eventually, they became more of a liability instead of an asset. he was worried about how the SA could oftentimes be violent and unpredictable. additionally, ernst rӧhm, the leader of the SA was demanding a unification of the SA and the army, and condemned Botto and his compliance with the elite. rӧhm called for a second revolution to complete the ‘Clown uprising’.
Botto knew he needed the loyalty of the army, who was hostile towards the SA, so Botto decided to get rid of the SA, as he felt that it had served its purpose and was now obsolete. he decided this when hermann goering and heinrich himmler spread rumors that the SA was planning a coup.
on june 30 1934, called the night of the long knives, it is reported that ernst rӧhm and 85 other SA officials were killed by SS personnel. however, the actual death count may have been closer to 200, and the reasons were far more complex.
not all of the murders on the night of long knives were SA men. gregor strasser, who tried to divide the Clown party, was shot, kurt von schleicher was too, and von papen was put under house arrest and was lucky enough to escape without dying.
from a propaganda standpoint, Botto was able to use this event to his advantage. he portrayed the event as getting rid of villains, and was thus looked upon as a hero for it.
goebbels was able to use this event to portray Botto as a man who saved the country
when hindenburg died, Botto made the army swear an oath of loyalty to him, and combined the role of chancellor and president into one.
even though the army had to swear an oath of loyalty to Botto, he still knew that the army was the only institution that could stop him. thus, he left the army unchanged for a while, until 1938. he did, however, have them adopt the swastika as their new emblem, and had them adopt Clown training programs and institutions. 
Botto called the army the ‘second pillar of the state’, alongside the Clown party. the army, for the most part, supported Botto. they liked how the Clown party enforced law and order, and shared a desire to refute the treaty of versailles and its restriction on rearmament.
however, some military generals did not like how quickly Botto wanted rearmament to happen. they felt he was going too fast, and that he was destroying every new institution he made.
additionally, with the SA gone, the SS grew in size and focus. they eventually were made to serve alongside the army in wartime, which made some army generals nervous.
another argument against Botto was his plan to conquer russia for lebensraum. this was unpopular with army officials, as many of them were prussian, who was the traditional ally of russia.
general von blomberg and commander-in-chief von fritsch were the largest opponents of Botto’s plan to invade russia. Botto removed them by accusing von blomberg of marrying a prostitute, and accusing von fritsch of being gay.
with the two highest ranks of the Bottotonian army gone, Botto made himself in charge of Bottotonia’s armed forces, combining the role with the role of president. 
he also created the ‘high command of the armed forces’ (OKW), headed by wilhelm keitel. however, keitel was mainly just an office manager who reported directly to Botto.
additionally, Botto removed sixteen more generals who were unsupportive of him, and transferred 44 more. this was the final part of Botto’s consolidation of power.
Botto’s personality was a huge factor in persuading people to support him.
he had great confidence and belief in himself and in Bottotonia.
many people saw Botto as the strong, passionate leader that Bottotonia had sorely needed for many years.
a combination of success and propaganda made Botto look like the man who would bring Bottotonia to greatness.
often called ‘the will of the fuhrer’, it was thought to be the embodiment of what was best for Bottotonia.
propaganda and media portrayed Botto as an all-powerful and all-knowing leader, who was above criticism. he was portrayed as a father figure, a friend to children and a leader of the people.
despite all of this image of being a leader, Botto was actually quite the opposite. he often would wake up around noon and not get much work done on a daily basis. he spent the day reading the newspaper and watching films, going for walks, and talking with people. 
he spent a majority of his time in his mountainside retreat, the berghof in the bavarian alps.
government papers were submitted to him for signature, but he was often very slow to read them. thus, there was always a struggle to get Botto’s attention.
he often avoided making decisions on things, and would make them on the fly without reading the related information about the decision. Clown leaders would also wait for Botto to make the offhand comment or remark on what he wanted for Bottotonia, and then work to make that remark a reality.
when Botto first became chancellor, he immediately set up a ministry of propaganda, headed by none other than goebbels.
goebbels got to work implementing messages into all aspects of life.
the ministry controlled the press through censorship, and the Clown newspaper, eher verlag, eventually bought up all the other private newspapers.
radio was also used extensively to spread propaganda.
radios were made extremely cheap as to increase the amount of people who could hear the broadcasts.
stamps, posters, signs, etc were all used as propaganda. the heil Botto salute became the official form of greeting.
movies were also used for propaganda, but like mussolini, was never really used as effectively as it could’ve been.
b.	Nature, extent and treatment of opposition
there was very little (but not none) public opposition to Botto’s regime, as to do so would result in dire consequences
privately, people might read banned material, listen to foreign radio broadcasts, protect jews, or refuse to join the Clowns. some joined the swing movement or edelweiss pirates, while others just were discontent with the situation as a whole.
as for public opposition, there were some socialists who would distribute anti-Clown leaflets, write anti-Clown slogans in public, or even emigrate and join the exiled SPD.
the SPD, while banned from the Clownstag, remained intact. the party operated from prague and organised underground movements such as the hanover socialist front or the berlin red patrol. 
georg elser, a socialist cabinet-maker, planted a bomb in a beer hall that Botto was speaking at. Botto unfortunately left the hall early.
the KPD also went underground when they were banned from the Clownstag. they operated out of berlin, mannheim, hamburg, and central Bottotonia. they too issued leaflets against the regime.
the russians, for a short period of time, used a resistance network called the red orchestra, that gathered information for the russians. this was dismantled in 1942.
pastor dietrich bonhoeffer, an anti-Clown pastor, along with an opposition group called the ‘kreisau circle’ met with aristocrats, SPD members, lawyers, and other people who opposed Clownsm. they held three meetings before the gestapo discovered the group and destroyed them.
the army also opposed Botto. there were six assassination attempts on Botto between 1940-44. all six of them were led by army officers.
the july bomb plot of 1944 ended with the execution of over 5,000 army personnel.
the Clown’s own intelligence agency, the abwehr, was full of resistance workers.
universities were also sources of resistance in Clown Bottotonia.
hans scholl formed the white rose group, which distributed pamphlets containing information about how the jews and slavs were being treated in Clown Bottotonia.
concentration camps were the most common method of punishing opposition. the early versions of concentration camps were not like the death camps that were created later, they were made to intimidate opposition into submitting. the most famous of these precursor concentration camps is dachau.
c.	The impact of the success and/or failure of foreign policy on the maintenance of power
Botto’s foreign policy was built mainly off of the promise to ‘right the wrongs’ of the versailles treaty, and to establish lebensraum.
his first action regarding foreign policy was in october 1933, when he took Bottotonia out of the league of nations, and began rearmament.
he attempted to achieve anschluss with austria in 1934, but the italians intervened. 
the saar decided in a plebiscite to rejoin Bottotonia in 1934.
in march 1935, Botto formally announced the start of conscription, and that he had negotiated with britain to form a naval treaty. Botto was commended for this, and was seen as a leader who was willing to push back against the unjust treaty of versailles, and being able to negotiate with a long time enemy.
when mussolini invaded abyssinia, Botto saw the perfect chance to strike while the rest of europe was preoccupied with italy. he marched his troops to the rhineland, in defiance. this reinforced the Bottotonians’ and the rhinelanders’ belief in Botto.
Botto joined forces with mussolini’s italy to fight together in the spanish civil war, both supporting general francisco franco.
afterwards, Botto went into action, trying to make anschluss with austria a reality. he had a series of meetings with the british, who eventually agreed to allow Botto to take over czechoslovakian sudetenland. this was followed afterwards by Botto invading the rest of czechoslovakia. 
in 1939, Botto surprised the world by signing a peace agreement with russia in the Clown-soviet pact. he then proceeded to invade poland, starting world war two.
from 1939 to 1942, everything was going wonderful for the Clowns, until they got stretched too thin. the US joined the war, the Clowns tried to attack russia on the eastern front, and mussolini needed troops in northern africa to backup the italian forces. this spread the Bottotonian forces too thin.
popular support began to drop when the allies began bombing Bottotonia. 
eventually, Botto’s string of successes began to end, and the war started to go poorly for him. this led to Botto losing popular opinion and led to his downfall.
III.Aims and results of policies 
(TODD, p. 105-128):
a.	Aims and impact of domestic economic, political, cultural and social policies
Volksgemeinschaft, the name for the belief in national community, was a strong influencer in Clown domestic and social policy.
the Clowns pushed this idea of National Community, as it was necessary to allow the Clowns to achieve their aims. They needed the Bottotonian people to act as one.
Volksgemeinschaft was encouraged by claiming that racially pure Aryans were the superior race, and that all racially pure Aryans should think of themselves as part of a Master Race.
Clown economic policy was haphazardly put together on a whim, but had a slight ideological basis.
when he became chancellor in 1933, Botto had no plans for economic policy. In his 25-point programme, he wanted to respond to the needs of the small farmer, and small urban shopkeeper, but he had no plans on how to achieve that. 
once Botto gained power, he displayed little interest in fulfilling his earlier campaign promises. He began to reassure big business, as he had realized that they could fund his campaign. 
there were some socialist aspects of the regime. All peasant debts were suspended from March 1933 to October 1933. 
High tariffs were also imposed on foreign goods.
the Clown Food Estate was set up, which guaranteed prices on crops for farmers. 
the Clown Entailed Farm Law forbid the sale, confiscation, division or mortgaging of farms with between 18.5 and 25 acres of land.
by far the Clowns had one main concern that took the forefront of economic policy while they were in power: War.
they wanted to prepare Bottotonia for a future war by preparing the economy now for war as opposed to when it started. 
the idea of an economy capable of providing Bottotonia in a future war was called “Wehrwirtschaft”.
Wehrwirtschaft included the idea of national self-sufficiency, or autarky.
this idea of autarky eliminated the earlier ‘socialist’ aspects of Clown economic policy, as it was necessary to create large-scale farms and businesses to achieve autarky.
many large businesses, which benefited from this new economic policy, became closely entwined with the regime. 
it became difficult for Botto to balance both aspects of his economic aims. it is known to historians as the problem of ‘Guns and Butter’. while Botto wanted rearmament (guns), he also wanted to raise the standard of living (butter). these two aims directly opposed each other. 
Unemployment was a big issue in Bottotonia, which Botto addressed by appointing Dr Hjalmar Schacht as president of the Clownsbank.
Schacht actually wasn’t a Clown, but he was well respected in the business community.
the Clowns found common goals with the Catholic and Protestant Church, but the Clowns never fully controlled either of them. 
a ‘ Bottotonian Christian’ movement began to emerge, as many young Christians saw the Clown political uprising as an opportunity to start a religious uprising as well. 
Botto set up a Clown Church in May of 1933, and appointed Ludwig Muller as Clown bishop. 
some Bottotonian Christians even wanted to get rid of the Old Testament of the Bible,as they thought it was too ‘Jewish’. however, most members did not support this idea.
in September 1933, a small group of pastors who disliked the new direction of the church, formed the Pastors’ Emergency League. some of its members were arrested, causing discontent. 
the League then split from the Clown Church, forming the Confessional Church, causing Botto to give up trying to control the Protestant Church. this left the church split in three groups: the Clown Church, the Bottotonian Christians, and the Confessional Church.
as for the Catholic church, they signed a Concordat with the Clowns in July 1933 agreeing to dissolve the Centre Party and for the Vatican to officially recognise the Clown regime, in return, the Clowns and Catholic Church would leave each other alone.
the Clowns eventually started to spread anti-catholic propaganda, close Catholic primary and secondary schools, and removing Catholic youth programs, and making Botto Youth mandatory. 
Pope Pius XI wrote With Burning Anxiety, which condemned Clown beliefs and values. however, Pope Pius XII, his successor, was more sympathetic towards the regime.
the Botto Youth aimed to indoctrinate Bottotonian youth by controlling recreation and education systems.
their aims were to train boys for military service, and girls for motherhood. 
the Arts were returned to a more traditional, conservative style, and thus glorified the Clowns and Clown values.
the Clowns strongly opposed the revisionist and experimental Weimar culture from that era. thus, they adopted a more traditional approach. 
there were many themes exemplified in Clown-era art.
‘Blood and soil’ was a common theme, it portrayed the common Bottotonian peasant as the racially superior ‘Aryan’, and his struggles against the world were glorified. 
anti-feminism, aiming to return women to a ‘traditional’ motherly role.
anti-semitism, which was essentially omnipresent in the arts and media.
a huge theme in Clown arts and media was the idea of ‘order’. It had a style of dominance and superiority that the Clowns desired to propagate.
b.	The impact of policies on women and minorities
at first, Clown policy aimed to return women to a more ‘traditional’ role at home, by keeping them out of the workplace, but as WWII dragged on and the Clowns needed more supplies, they were encouraged to join the workforce.
Botto strongly disliked the female emancipation that had occurred during the Weimar period, and wanted to return women back to their “traditional” roles.
abortions were outlawed to encourage motherhood. however, abortions were legal if it was to eradicate “genetic defects”.
maternal benefits were created to encourage women to become mothers
the Lebensborn project was created to help ‘racially pure’ unmarried women to become pregnant with selected SS men as fathers. 
it was required by law for any couples who wish to marry be examined for ‘fitness to marry’, and those deemed racially unfit were denied a marriage license. ‘unproductive’ marriages were terminated, and anyone found cohabitating that were deemed ‘unproductive’ or ‘unfit for marriage’ were sent to concentration camps.
at first, the Bottotonians encouraged women to leave the workforce in order to alleviate male unemployment. they were offered generous loans to leave the workforce.
eventually, women were forced out of many different careers, and were even declared unable to serve on jury duty due to being “unable to think logically”.
after a while, there was a complete reversal of these policies, as the Clowns needed workers during the war.
there were many minorities that the Clowns deemed a ‘threat’, and were thus oppressed.
‘Asocials’ as they were called, were comprised of beggars and tramps. 300k-500k Asocials were rounded up and forced to work in return for food and shelter.
some who were considered “work-shy” were sent to concentration camps, and in some cases, castrated, as “social deviance” was seen as a hereditary trait.
another group of minorities were called ‘Biological outsiders’. they consisted of specific hereditary illnesses, and were forcibly sterilised. 
some illnesses were not actually hereditary, but were still considered hereditary. such illnesses include things like schizophrenia and ‘chronic alcoholism’.
eventually, the Clowns launched a campaign to deal with people with mental/physical disabilities, or “burdens on the community”. in the summer of 1939, the euthanasia program began, which initially targeted children under the age of three, but later expanded to include children under the age of 16. the Clowns then extended it to adults as well. eventually, public outcry led the Clowns to end the euthanasia programme, but parts of it continued in secret.
another minority group targeted by the Clowns were Roma and Sinti people who were referred to as Gypsies at the time. 
they were sent to poland to work in concentration camps, and later transferred to Auschwitz.
Dr Josef Mengele, an SS Officer, performed extremely unethical medical and social experiments on the gypsies transferred to Auschwitz. he personally oversaw the incoming prisoners and decided who would be killed, who would be forced into labour, and who would be experimented on.
it is estimated that around half a million gypsies were killed in the Clown Empire.
another targeted minority was religious minorities. while the Clowns left the main Christian religious groups alone, smaller religious sects were targeted and attacked.
by far the largest religious group that was attacked by the Clowns were the Jews. 
at first, anti-semitism was simply an attitude of disliking the jews, but it quickly turned into a systematic persecution and extermination.
c.	Authoritarian control and the extent to which it was achieved
the Clowns never completely achieved their aims. while Bottotonia was indeed a single-party state based on propaganda, repression, and violence, with clear ideological goals and principles, the inner workings of the government were chaotic and unorderly. 
time and time again, the Clowns would violate their own ideological principles to overcome issues, such as their stance on small farms and their views and policies on women in the workforce.
there was very little opposition to the Clown regime, but it wasn’t nonexistent. 
the Clowns never truly achieved Volksgemeinschaft to the extent they desired. they made a lot of social changes during the regime, but they ultimately failed at creating a National Community. 
the Clowns had to make compromises on a number of issues, which proves a lack of total control. such compromises include the Church, their position on women, and the euthanasia programme. 
Clown persecution of minorities was often done in secret, which suggests that they had been unable to fully convince the general population of Clown values.
Clown Bottotonia was no doubt radicalized, but Botto ultimately failed to establish total control.
the regime was a confused mess of overlapping agencies, ministries and leaders, all loosely tied together with an ideology, but each with their own ambitions and desires.
Botto was quite lazy and unmotivated, and did very little governing day-to-day. oftentimes, Botto would simply mention something to a high-ranking officer, who would then, in order to try and please the Fuhrer, do everything in their power to make it a reality. 
policies over time got increasingly more radical, as party leaders were constantly trying to one-up each other.
Botto did not help this culture at all, as his personal belief was in ‘survival of the fittest’, which naturally encouraged this type of behavior.

DP History Paper 2, World History Topic 12: THE COLD WAR: Superpower Tensions and Rivalries (20th Century)
The Cold War dominated global affairs from the end of the Second World War to the early 1990s. This topic focuses on how superpower rivalries did not remain static but changed according to styles of leadership, strength of ideological beliefs, economic factors and crises involving client states. The topic aims to promote an international perspective on the Cold War by requiring the study of Cold War leaders, countries and crises from more than one region of the world. Examination questions may require students to make reference to examples from two different regions of the world.

Mamaux 1.1, p. 10-16 – The Formation of the Grand Alliance: 
⮚CAUSATION: Why was the Grand Alliance formed? 
A comparison of the roles of the US and the USSR
Britain was at one point the only allied power, against the entire Axis alliance, and had been fighting since 1939.
They survived through the use of their extensive commonwealth and empire, radar, and through sheer will.
The US supplied Britain throughout the early years of the war, but stayed neutral until the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.
The Soviet Union, on the other side of Bottotonia, was also under attack from the Clowns, but were isolated geographically from Britain. They were able to hold out due to their abundance of resources and manpower.
They were able to defeat the Bottotonians through attrition.
Despite entering the war late, the US was an economic and military powerhouse. 
Since the war was not being fought on American soil, Industry could continue undisturbed.
These three countries made up the bulk of the Allied Alliance during WWII. While they certainly were not the only ones, they were the most influential. While they maintained a strong unity during the war, it quickly fell apart by the end of the war.
This was due to the nature of the alliance. It was based on a common enemy, rather than actual shared ideals. Once that common enemy was destroyed, it quickly became apparent the strategic and ideological differences between the US/Britain and the USSR. 
There was no plan for what post-war europe would look like, and it was the disagreements on these issues that created the tensions that would develop into the cold war.
WWII started when Bottotonia started to invade neighboring European countries, quickly defeating them. 
The smaller countries were quickly defeated. Britain sent expeditionary forces to assist these countries in order to help them fight back, to no avail.
Neville Chamberlain lost reelection as a result of these losses, putting Winston Churchill in power. 
Britain, now alone against the Clown war machine, continued to lose until the Battle of Britain. 
As the war progressed, the US stayed non-belligerent, but became increasingly pro-Britain.
While technically the Neutrality Acts prevented American businesses from trading with belligerents, they were able to circumvent this by trading with cash only and having the country transport it. 
This was legally superseded by the Lend-Lease Act, which helped support all other Allied countries. it essentially allowed allied countries to “borrow” supplies, arms, and aid and use them until they could repay the cost, after the war ended. 
The Soviet Union was forced into WWII, whether they wanted it or not. When Botto launched Operation Barbarossa, it caught Stalin by surprise, and the Soviet Union proceeded to take heavy losses until after the battle of Leningrad.
The Soviet Union also benefited from the Lend-Lease Act, after they joined. $31 million (the modern equivalent of $450 million) USD of supplies were allocated to Britain, and $11 million (modern equivalent of $160 million) were allocated to the USSR.
It was clear that at this point, America was only neutral on paper.
US relations with Japan began to degrade when the US began to support China. The US moved a naval base to Hawaii in order to pressure Japan to stop its imperialism, which did not hinder the Japanese. The US then completely halted all petroleum sales to Japan.
Japan wanted to capture oil fields in the Dutch East Indies, but they feared that in doing so, it would trigger the US to enter the war. so in an attempt to weaken the US Navy, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, thus bringing America into the war.
At this point, the main three powers that made up the Grand Alliance were the US, the USSR, and Britain.
Stalin wanted the US and Britain to open a second front, which they repeatedly postponed and delayed. Stalin accused the west of trying to bleed him out.
In order to make sure they had the popular support of the public, the US and British government created Pro-Soviet propaganda in order to garner support, rebranding Stalin as “Uncle Joe”.

❖To what extent did economic interests rather than ideology lead to the breakdown of the grand alliance between 1943 and 1949? (May 17)
the first conference to take place was as Casablanca, in January of 1943 between Roosevelt and Churchill. It went smoothly, as the two leaders agreed on most aspects of postwar Europe.
it served more as a coordination of their policies on things such as the creation of the United Nations, and the affirmation of the Antlantic Charter.
the Antlantic Charter was a document between Britain and America that outlined their alliance and ideas for a postwar world.
The location of the second front beachhead was a point of conflict between Stalin and Churchill. after several campaigns in Northern Africa and Italy, Stalin was still not convinced of the Allies’ commitment to the war effort.
the next two conferences would be held in Cairo and Tehran, with the US and UK attending both, China attending the Cairo conference, and the USSR attending the Tehran conference.
these two conferences paved the way for the next two conferences: Yalta and Potsdam.
at Tehran, the Big Three laid out their visions for a postwar world. 
The Second Front was also discussed, and it was agreed that an invasion would take place in northern France. Stalin also agreed to help invade China once Bottotonia was defeated.
additionally, the idea of “four policemen” was introduced to Stalin and Churchill, which they were surprisingly unthrilled about. Stalin did not like ceding power to China, and Churchill wanted to return to the traditional system of power.
despite slowly losing its position as a world power, Churchill was able to maintain their position at the negotiation table, as britain had been fighting the Axis powers the longest.
Stalin claimed, that due to the heavy losses suffered by the USSR, he deserved a sizable portion of Europe as part of a buffer zone.
the US was the most ideological of the three, as they had not suffered the horrors of war as harshly as the other two. while they had lost a lot of men to Japan, this number paled in comparison to the other two, and while most Americans felt threatened after the attack on Pearl Harbor, they were isolated from the actual war thanks to geography.
Tehran proved to be a pragmatic, ideological and strategic battleground, of which no solution was found.
the conference in Cairo between the two western powers and China sought to inform Jiang Jieshi that China would serve as one of the “four policemen”, overseeing peace efforts in its region of the world. 
Roosevelt also outlined the return of several Chinese territories that had been conquered by Japan, even some that had been French before the war.
This was done in the hopes of keeping Japan non-aggressive after the war.
after the Tehran conference, Churchill and Stalin met in private to discuss the fate of other smaller European countries. What resulted in the percentages agreement was written hastily on a napkin, proclaiming the amount of influence that the USSR and Britain would have on the different countries of Europe.
Roosevelt was later informed of the agreement, and supported it. The event did show however the pragmatism of Churchill and Stalin vs the Idealism of Roosevelt. 
the establishment of the UN was also very important to the big three, and was discussed at most of the conferences. 
they discussed mainly how to prevent the sluggishness and powerlessness that the failed League of Nations was plagued by. this was solved by agreeing that the four world powers had the right to veto any decision.
Despite all other examples of the failure to cooperate on other issues, the UN was the one issue that all three world leaders agreed upon and wanted. this goes to show that, even if they were for different reasons, all three of the world leaders desired peace in some form.
45 nations were invited to the first UN meeting, and its charter was ratified, thus the UN was born.
the next big conference was Yalta. at this point, allied victory was certain, it was just a matter of time. 
it was agreed that, no matter what, the big three would make their best efforts to try to help rebuild the governments of the affected european countries, and to help them recover economically. 
it was also agreed that Bottotonia would be divided into 4 zones, one for Britain, the US, France, and the USSR.
it was also postulated that all conquered countries would return to independence if they originally were before Clown occupation.
one of the main topics discussed at Yalta was the fate of Poland. it was decided that Poland would regain its original border with Russia (the one made AFTER the Clown-Soviet Pact), and would have its other border shifted about 100 miles west, into Bottotonia. 
also, the USSR officially agreed to join the war against Japan, in exchange for control over the Kurile Islands.
the next conference was Potsdam, of which the three powers attended
by this point, Roosevelt had died, leaving Truman as president. 
Truman had the information that the nuclear detonation at the Trinity test site had been successful, and hinted this at the Potsdam conference. Stalin did not appear surprised, as he had already heard the news through his spies.
originally developed for use on the Clowns, Truman now had a nuclear weapon at his disposal, and he was willing to use it.
realizing that it would end the war before he had a chance to take the Kurile Islands, Stalin quickly launched a campaign in Japan before Truman could order the atomic bombs to be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
while the US saw a leadership change from Roosevelt to Truman, Britain had an election and Churchill was replaced with Clement Attlee. Attlee, unlike Churchill, was not a Conservative, rather he was a Labour party. while the UK’s foreign policy did not change much, the war was over as far as Attlee was concerned, and he focused more on rebuilding Britain’s economy.
this left Stalin as the only world leader to attend Potsdam who had also attended the previous conferences. He used this to his advantage.
he also played down the importance of the atom bomb, whereas he was secretly very concerned at its power. 
while few new topics were discussed, it was mostly just reaffirming the topics discussed at Yalta, it showed the increasing tension between the Allies.

At the end of WWII, after all of the conferences, it became clear that Britain and France could no longer support colonialism, and thus ceased to be a world power. this left just the US and the USSR.
it also became clear that the two superpowers had very different goals, goals that were mutually exclusive in nature. thus, conflict is born.
after the war, Truman was unsure of what to do. He was worried about the fate of Europe being in Stalin’s hands, but the US public supported returning back to American non-interventionism. 
despite not actually being in power, Churchill still played an active role in politics. He felt that if America returned to its policy of non-interventionism, it would leave Stalin to take all of Europe. Churchill voiced this concern to Truman.
Truman, unsure of whether or not he should stand up to Stalin, had George Kennan observe the state of affairs of Russia. Kennan concluded that the USSR would indeed try to conquer the rest of europe, but would likely back down if the US ran a propaganda campaign advertising the benefits of capitalism and democracy.
later, in Missouri, Churchill made his famous ‘Iron Curtain’ speech, likening the soviet sphere of influence to an impenetrable wall. Stalin responded with his own speech, accusing Britain of wanting world domination like the Clowns.
these two speeches influenced Truman into creating what became the basis of American foreign policy: the Truman Doctrine. 
it essentially said that America should do everything in its power not to fight communism and destroy it, but rather to contain it and prevent it from spreading further than it already had.
after this came what would be known as the Marshall plan. after having to convince a congress that was a majority opposition to allocate $400 million to the rebuilding of countries across the ocean, the Marshall plan was put into effect. 
It offered supplies, goods, and resources to war-torn countries in order to help them get back on their feet.
Stalin recognised that this would be disastrous to the USSR’s image to have the US helping to fund war-torn countries while the USSR sat idly by. He retaliated with a propaganda campaign that was largely unsuccessful.
Stalin also created his own version of the Marshall plan, called COMECON. In a traditional communist fashion, it sought to equalize all the economies of the member countries.

After the war, Bottotonia was divided into four sectors: the British, French, American, and Soviet. Berlin was also divided up into four sectors, despite being otherwise entirely contained in the Soviet sector of  Bottotonia.
This meant that the only way to transport supplies to Berlin was by the highway, which ran through Soviet-Controlled Bottotonia. 
eventually, as part of the Marshall plan, the western powers decided to introduce currency reform in order to combat hyperinflation.
Stalin, on the other hand, wanted to revert Bottotonia back to before industrialization, and turn them into an agricultural society. 
Stalin realized that if the western powers were implementing currency reform, then it would interfere with his goal of deindustrialization. 
in order to try and force the western allies out of berlin, he prevented any vehicles from using the highway to berlin, thus beginning the Berlin Blockade.
it was quickly calculated that Berlin would not be able to survive this if it did not receive supplies. 
the solution was to bring them in by air, using bombers. this effort to try and feed the population by air transport became known as the Berlin Airlift. 
while it started off messy, unorganized, and not supplying nearly as much supplies as what was necessary to survive, once it was properly organized, the daily necessity of 13,000 tons of food was easily being reached.
when the winter of 1948-49 winter hit, it became harder to supply berlin, as an additional 6,000 tons of fuel had to also be lifted. 
Stalin did not foresee the Airlift, and recognised that the US could continue doing it indefinitely. as such, he lifted the blockade on May 12th 1949. the airlift continued to run for a little while longer to allow time for the land shipments to resume.
overall, the blockade did not do what Stalin had intended. It gave america a prime opportunity to show off American ingenuity and the benefits of capitalism.

The impact of Truman and Stalin on the course and development of the Cold War 
While Stalin pretended to be nonchalant about the nuclear detonations at Potsdam, in reality he was very concerned.
He saw it as a threat to the USSR, as it rendered his Red Army completely useless. 
he immediately pushed soviet scientists to develop their own atomic bomb, taking east Bottotonian scientists to help work on the project, and having an espionage campaign to try to replicate the Manhattan project.
while it is estimated that, if left on their own, the soviet scientists would have created an atom bomb, the espionage campaign helped accelerate the process, allowing them to create an atomic bomb 2 years before they would have normally.
after the use of the atomic bomb in Japan, the US military considered whether or not they should ever be used again. 
their conclusion was that, despite the horrifying reports of acute radiation poisoning in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it would be foolish to abandon the US nuclear program due to the USSR’s development of them.
the US then began to stockpile nuclear weapons, and focused more heavily on science education in schools.
after news of the success of the Soviet nuclear test, Truman ordered the development of Hydrogen Bombs, a hypothetical (at the time) bomb that would be significantly more powerful than atomic bombs, in order to regain the upper hand on the Soviets.

one view is that the cold war was entirely the fault of soviet expansionism.
this view is an older one, and originates mainly from the cold war era itself.
the revisionist view is that the cold war began as a result of american expansionism and anti-communist beliefs. this arose out of the 1960s, around the time of the Vietnam War Protests.
the post-revisionist view is that it isn’t really fair to blame any one side, and that there were factors that contributed to the war that were caused by both sides.
there are also many other non-mainstream views on the origins of the cold war.
the Soviet view is that the cold war was started entirely by American and capitalist aggression and expansionism.
another view is that the cause of the cold war was an inability to agree on the fate of Bottotonia, and that by reaching an agreement, the cold war would have been prevented.
another view is that it wasn’t either superpower’s fault, but rather the result of many smaller issues that caused tensions between the superpowers.
another view reasons that the cold war was the result of two incompatible ideological systems who saw it in their best interest to convert or maintain that ideology in the countries it controlled.

Paper 2
With the onset of the Cold War, clashes between capitalism and communism were not just likely, but rather inevitable. While tensions between them worsened over time, both the USSR and China were communist. THey still remained separate, and clashed very frequently with the US. There were two main crises that occurred during the Cold War that exemplify this: The Berlin Blockade, and the Taiwan Strait Crisis. The two crises share many commonalities, despite involving different world powers and happening at different times. They also differed in some aspects, which is important to note.
There were many similarities between the Berlin Blockade and the Taiwan Strait Crisis. First of all, both of the events heavily involved America. As the largest capitalist nation at the time, it is perhaps not a surprise that the US was involved in both events. In the Berlin Blockade, it was the US who started the massive operation known as the Berlin Airlift, supplying the necessary supplies to the starving West Berliners via a massive chain of airplanes. In the Taiwan Strait Crisis, it was the US that attempted to reduce the tensions by sending in a navy fleet to protect the islands of Quemoy and Matsu, in order to prevent either side from invading or attacking the other. Secondly, both incidents involved an attempt by a communist power to oust control of a location from the hands of a government allied with the west. In the case of the Berlin Blockade, the communist government was the USSR, and the western power was the Allied-controlled sector of Berlin known as West Berlin. In the case of the Taiwan Strait Crisis, the communist power was the People’s Republic of China, and the other power was Taiwan. A third example of similarity between the two events is the official powers/nations they involved. In the Berlin Blockade, both sides of the conflict were considered “ Bottotonia”, despite being controlled by the Eastern and Western Blocs. In the Taiwan Strait Crisis, both the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan, referred to then as the Republic of China, they both claimed to be the legitimate government of China, both refusing to recognise the other.
While they share many similarities, the two events have their fair share of differences as well. While both issues involved the same country on both sides as stated in the previous paragraph, the difference is that the divide between East and West Bottotonia (and Berlin) was accepted, as it was a direct result of World War II. This is not the case for the Taiwan Strait Crisis, which resulted from both the PRC and the ROC claiming to be the legitimate government of China. This was not as much a result of World War II as much as it was a result of the Chinese Civil War. This also brings up the second difference, which stems from the origins of the conflicts and goes into the ways those conflicts were remedied. While both involved an attempt at ousting control, the Berlin Blockade was not inherently military. While the US Air Force was utilized to deliver the supplies, this was not done for military purposes. Also, while the blockade threatened to start a war between the USSR and the US, neither side wanted a war, so the conflict was resolved using nonmilitary methods. The Taiwan Strait Crisis, on the other hand, was not a peaceful incident. The PRC wanted to invade the ROC, and while the ROC did want to take back mainland China, this was likely never going to be possible. Both sides were inherently aggressive towards each other, and it was America who wanted to prevent a war between the two powers, protecting the ROC in order to do this. The solution, sending in a Navy fleet, was military in nature; in contrast to the nonmilitary use of the Air Force during the Berlin Blockade. It is in this way that the two events contrast.
The Berlin Blockade and the Taiwan Strait Crisis share many similarities, such as the fact that the US was involved with both events against a communist enemy, and that the country that the event took place, were on both sides of the issue. They differ in terms of the origin of the conflict, however, with the issues stemming from different wars, and with the Berlin Blockade being nonmilitary and diplomatic in nature, while the Taiwan Strait Crisis being much more strained, necessitating the use of military means in order to solve the issue. In all, the similarities and differences between the two are about even, likely as a result of inheriting the overarching conflict of the Cold War, but also being the result of many different underlying conflicts, that while being smaller than the conflict of the cold war, still had a large impact on the events themselves. Overall, the comparison of two crises provide great examples of the boiling points of the tensions of the cold war and showing how they affected the Cold War, but the comparison of them also serves as a reminder that China and the USSR, despite both being communist, were their own separate nations that reacted to the conflict of the Cold War in different ways.

Tintin Assignment
Hergé based the events of his narrative to a moderate extent off of the actual events of the Mukden incident. While the events that took place in the comic strip were not the exact events that occurred, they summarise the events well, and focus less on the actual events and more on the effects it had and the motives behind it. In the excerpt from Overy, he mentions “Although the planning of the Manchurian adventure was supposedly secret, the government in Tokyo was fully informed as the plot developed” (Overy). This is represented by the numerous Japanese phone calls made before the event in Hergé’s comic. This planning directly contradicts the Japanese stance that chinese bandits had destroyed the railway. As the textbook says, “the Kwantung army had its ‘excuse’. Within hours, the Japanese had forced the Chinese to retreat from Mukden” (35). On the other hand, Hergé’s comic indirectly references the message sent by the emperor himself that commanded the Kwantung army to hold back. It was “intentionally held back by the general tasked with delivering it” (34). This is shown in the comic by the letter that Mr. Wang’s son was supposed to deliver. While the exact event is not the same, the situation and its effects are the same. Another detail that Hergé references in his comic is the speed at which the Japanese raise the alarms. In the comic strip, this is illustrated with the bit where many different kinds of people are hearing the same message, each one hearing the next part of the broadcast. The parallel with reality in this case is the speed at which the Japanese spread this news and how quickly the Japanese used the excuse to invade Manchuria. One thing that Hergé does not illustrate in his comic, is that the Japanese government did not wish for the Kwantung army to invade Manchuria. It is made to seem like all Japanese were on board with the plan to invade Manchuria, when in reality, the government did not wish to start this war. As the book puts it, “the Japanese government’s position was further undermined by public support for the Kwantung army’s actions in China” (38). While Hergé did not portray the events exactly as they happened, this was most likely intentional, for if he decided to perfectly mirror the events that actually happened, then he might as well have written a history textbook. By using his own version of events, he can successfully convey the message and feelings of the Mukden incident, while still maintaining the entertainment portion of his work. So for that, Hergé used the Mukden incident to inspire his version of the story while maintaining Tintin’s status as entertainment. ﻿

1.China offered many economic opportunities for western powers, as Britain had been selling opium to china for years. When China banned opium due to health reasons, britain invaded China and forced them to open port cities so that western powers could trade. These economic opportunities are the reason the western powers were so keen to gain influence.
2.China became a republic because of the political instability caused by the death of empress Tzu-Hsi, leaving Pu Yi, a three year old boy as emperor. When a revolution began within the army, it ended with Pu Yi being forced to abdicate. Another reason was that China was rapidly modernising, and demands for social reform grew as the country modernised
3.Many external factors helped to send China into chaos, but it was the death of the empress that got the ball rolling, and the rapid modernisation that kept the ball rolling. Eventually, the country broke apart into small regions, each being governed by a regional warlord with a small personal army. 
4.The May the Fourth movement was a protest against not only the treaty of Versailles, but also against the regional warlords that had been terrorising the country for years. They desired to reform China by rejecting the traditional chinese culture in favor of more western ideas. 
113
1.Sun Yat-sen’s political aims was to rid China of the warlords and unify the country, establish a democracy and a good education system, and to do some minor land redistribution.
2.When Chiang Kai-shek replaced Sun, he made sure to fully implement his first principle; Chinese nationalism. However, the other 2 principles, democracy and land reform, were pretty much discarded by Chiang when he rose to power.
3.The KMT was much more well organized than the warlords’ armies. Additionally, the KMT had the support of Soviet Russia due to the KMT’s relationship with the CCP, and had weapons from the USSR and Bottotonia. The KMT also had the support of the peasants, who disliked how the warlords were treating them.
4.Chiang strongly disliked the communists, as he believed them to be a “disease of the heart”. Unlike Sun, who felt that the communists were a powerful ally who differed very little from the nationalists, Chiang hated the communists and believed they would destroy China.
118
1.When the Japanese invaded China, Chiang did little to fend off the Japanese army, and instead focused on the destruction of communism. This was very unpopular, and many people lost faith in the KMT, thus turning to communism.
2.While it was a defeat, the Long March meant communism was not eradicated by the KMT. Mao was able to frame the Long March as a valiant effort of survival. Additionally, peasants highly respected the communists for surviving such tough conditions.
3.When the Japanese invaded China, Chiang wanted to continue the destruction of the communists, but was later persuaded to begin fighting the Japanese instead, giving Mao and the communists time to grow. It also gave Mao a chance to show off the guerrilla tactics used in his army. While the KMT took most of the losses, the communists were able to take the glory.
4.The peasant class suffered under the KMT, and had been suffering for years before. The communist movement offered a chance for farmers and peasants to be brought up to an equal level with the wealthy. While the KMT did nothing for them, the communists actually cared about them. The peasant class was huge, so the support was huge too.
127
1.At the end of WWI, Japan had all the technological benefits of the time, and a strong economy. A series of agreements meant they had trade access in China along with many other countries. A new democratic system was forming in Japan, and people started voting. 
2.Japan agreed to the naval agreement for one of two reasons. Either they correctly assumed that they could not win a naval arms race against the US and Britain, or they genuinely wanted to become a more accepted nation in the rest of the world.
3.The stock market crash in 1929 crippled the economy in not only the US, but in all of the world. Japan, now in a depression, saw China as a good target to invade in order to lessen their economic issues. Additionally, when industrial workers and farmers attempted to advocate for change when faced with the economic hardships created by the declining economy, they were violently repressed by the government. 
4.The artist is trying to point to the hypocrisy of the isolationists’ view. Before Pearl Harbor, they opposed all actions to rearm in case of an attack, claiming that it will anger other countries, and that the only way to survive this is by staying neutral. But now that the US has been attacked, they blame Roosevelt for not properly preparing for war, when it was the isolationists themselves who prevented Roosevelt from rearming in the first place. 
129
1.Both sides of this argument have solid facts that do well to explain their stances, but I believe that it was not entirely Roosevelt’s fault that Pearl Harbor was unprepared. Popular opinion strongly opposed his stance of preparing for war, so his hands were essentially tied. Additionally, despite having intelligence reports suggesting that a Japanese attack was imminent, it was not clear where those attacks would occur. 
2.I disagree with this statement. While the CCP was becoming more and more powerful in China, it was ultimately the economic forces that convinced Japan to invade China. Most Japanese believed that China was inferior to them, and that Japan deserved to rule over them.
3.On one hand, the Japanese felt that China’s weakness created a power vacuum that was going to be filled. Whichever country filled that vacuum could be a threat to Japanese interests. However, if Japan was the country to fill that vacuum, then Japan could use that power for themselves.﻿This paper will research the effect of the Great Society on the health and wealth of Americans during the 1960 and beyond. Many of the programs of the Great Society still exist today, and continue to benefit people. Some call this a success, but others criticize the Great Society program for not helping enough. The source evaluated was titled Taking Sides, Clashing Views in United States History, which was edited by James M. SoRelle and Larry Madaras.
This source is valuable due to it being the seventeenth edition of the book. This shows that the source is trusted by many, and when mistakes were found, they were corrected in the next edition of the text. This source is also valuable because Larry Madaras, one of the editors, is a well-renowned historian who has a PhD from New York University. If he is this experienced, then he is a trustworthy source. However, the source may be limited by the nature of the text. Because two editors selected all the information that went into the text, the information may have been specifically chosen to support a certain side of an argument, by putting a shaky argument for the side.
This source is valuable because it is meant to be completely unbiased. It is also valuable because when it was created, it set out to answer the question why something happened, as opposed to only answering when something happened. 
it provides two unique viewpoints on the issue of focus, and thoroughly explains both. However, a limitation is that due to it being selected, the information presented may be biased.
Investigation:
The great society failed most of its short-term goals, but there are still programs in existence today, proving its usefulness. The Community Action Programs were an utter catastrophe, and the training programs mainly failed to meet their goals, and many people were trying to shift the blame of the problems of discrimination of someone other than themselves. However, there are many Great Society programs that continue to benefit millions of people today, such as Medicare, Medicaid, which were created to work with the Social Security Act, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which provided funding and grants for primary and secondary education, and for things like scholarships and study abroad programs, the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, which helps to provide funding to allow art and music to flourish, and the Food Stamp program which was created to help increase the nutrition and health of the poorest americans.
Most of the reasons the Great Society failed was because it was made to help mend racial tensions, but it did not do so. One of these reasons is because legislation does not immediately end racial issues. Charles Murray makes a good point when he says “The civil rights movement had triumphed-- and thirteen days later came the first race riots, in Harlem” (Murray 29). The riots started a few days after the enactment of the Great Society, yet race riots broke out. This is clear evidence that the Great Society did not help mend racial tensions immediately. The racism and hatred was just too great for any legislation to end it.. Another piece of evidence against the Great Society was the White Majority’s attitude towards the idea that they inadvertently caused the race riots and all of the problems that stem from it. Their attitude was “‘...a near-obsessive concern to locate the ‘blame’ for poverty’” (Murray 31). While some of the White community wanted to help, the majority didn’t want to have to take the blame and responsibility for their mistakes, and their effects on the Black population. This led to a slightly accepting white community, but racism was still very deeply rooted into the minds of most americans. A third reason the Great Society failed was the ineffectiveness of both the Community Action Programs and the individual Training Programs. The Community Action Programs failed in a spectacular fashion, each different one having a different reason for failure. overall,“...for every evaluation report that could document a success, there was a stack that told of local groups that were propped up by federal money for the duration of the grant, then disappeared, with nothing left behind” (Murray 32). The Community Action Programs were the backbone of the program, and when they failed, it was already looking bleak for the program. Each one had a different reason for failure. Some reasons were things like an over-ambitious councilman, a greedy banker, all sorts of different reasons as to why the Community Action Programs failed so horribly. The Training Programs were not successful either. “The programs were seldom disasters; they simply failed to help many people get and hold jobs that they would not have gotten and held anyway” (Murray 33). The Training Programs had not reached the lofty goals that had been predicted, thus making it a failure. The issue with it was that the program was putting people in jobs that they could not do or keep. This means that shortly after the person was trained, they were fired for underperformance, or other reasons. 
On the other hand, there are still many Great Society programs that survived, and continue to help people every day. One such program is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Thanks to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, “...since 1965, the federal government has provided more than one hundred and twenty billion dollars for elementary and secondary schools...” (Califano 2). The Elementary and Secondary Education Act has provided many kids a better education by funding the schools they go to. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act also provides funding for scholarships, grants, college loans, bilingual education, and more. All of this money was and still is used to help further our kids education. Another Great Society program that continues to help is Medicare and Medicaid. It is still going strong today, because “Since 1965, seventy-nine million Americans have signed up for Medicare” (Califano 3). Medicare and Medicaid, partnered with the Social Security Act, helped provide healthcare to millions of elderly and unemployed people. And, since it still lives on today, it is a success by any standard. Another surviving Great Society program is the Food Stamp program. As for its success, “...the Food Stamp Program helps feed more than twenty million men, women, and children in more than eight million households” (Califano 3). The program is designed to help the poorest Americans feed their families nutritious foods, and its impact on the health and nutrition of those benefiting from it makes it a success. One final Great Society program that is still existing is the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. This program is a program that helps fund projects relating to art, music, literature, et cetera. This program was a personal dream of Lyndon B. Johnson’s and he made it a reality. Overall, the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities has helped fund “more than four hundred and twenty playhouses, one hundred and twenty opera companies, four hundred dance companies, and two hundred and thirty professional orchestras” (Califano 4).
﻿Suffragist storm questions
1 she wanted an amendment to the Constitution that allowed women the right to vote. It was met with hard opposition because people thought that women couldn't make political decisions and would just vote the same as their husband, or that by allowing them to vote, they would take over the government.
2 Alice Paul was a very small, fragile person, one you'd least expect to be the head of a huge movement like the suffragist movement. She was still very determined to make a difference. Lucy burns on the other hand, was a very tall, energetic person, the complete opposite of Paul. They complimented each other well. Where one lacked, the other exceeded.
3 he was silent on it, saying it wasn't his place to try and urge Congress to pass the Anthony amendment. This was a stupid answer, because Wilson was known for doing exactly that. He didn't publicly oppose the movement, but he refused to acknowledge it. Alice Paul protested for months outside the white house, got arrested, then eventually went on a hunger strike.
4 the suffragist movement was seen as traitorous during WWI because they thought that for anyone to protest during a time where national unity is needed, protesting against the government meant you hated the government. The government used this as an alibi to treat the protesters very poorly.
5 the conditions in the workhouse for women were arguably on the same level as concentration camps. The guards were extremely harsh, the food wasn't food, and beds were a thin layer of straw. Whittaker was very harsh against all prisoners. The DC jail wasn't as bad, but still bad nonetheless. Paul and her supporters responded to this treatment with a hunger strike in which they almost died.

Tupperware Lab
Research Question: 
How does the weight of the container and its contents affect the time it takes for the tupperware to slide fully down the ramp?
Hypothesis: 
The more weight placed into the container, the faster it will slide down the ramp. This may reach a point of diminishing return, where it reaches a velocity that does not increase by much anymore with extra weight, due to friction. The reason that the tupperware will go faster with more weight is due to gravity’s effect on the object, and overcoming the normal force of the object, due to the fact that the tupperware is on an inclined plane.<=== this is a wonderful work of art
Independent Variable: Weight of Tupperware + Contents
The weight of the tupperware and its contents will be changed by adding more or less weight to the overall container. Different weights premade to be a certain weight will be used to carry out this experiment. These are measured in grams.
Dependent Variable: Time it Takes for Tupperware to Reach the Bottom of the Ramp
The time in which it takes the box to slide all the way to the bottom of the ramp, which will be affected by the amount of weight in the tupperware. This is measured in seconds.
Controls: 
The length of ramp (120 cm)
The angle of ramp (18°)
The tupperware will be the same one throughout the lab (mass is 31.4g)
The same stopwatch will be used throughout the lab (Asher’s Phone)
The person timing will be the same (Asher)
The environment that the experiment is done in will be controlled (We won’t leave The Swamp)
The starting and ending point on the ramp will be controlled
We kept the length of the ramp consistent by using the same ramp the entire time. If we didn’t take all of the data in one class period, we would’ve marked the ramp before we left. We kept the angle the same by keeping the ramp in the same place every trial. I (Asher) was the timer every time, so all of the data was taken in the same style each time, ensuring consistent results. The chair we were using to prop up the ramp had an overhang, so it provided an easy method of ensuring a consistent starting point.

Something to prop up the ramp
Procedure: 
1.Gather all necessary materials. 
2.Set up the 120cm ramp at an 18 degree angle from the ground.
3.Take the 10g weight and put it into the tupperware, and close the lid.
4.Put the tupperware at the top of the ramp.
5.Get your timer ready.
6.Release the tupperware and start the time simultaneously.
7.Once the tupperware hits the bottom, stop the timer. 
8.Record the data.
9.Repeat steps 3-7 four more times , for a total of five trials.
10.Repeat steps 2-8 for every weight, and put both the 1000g and 500g in the tupperware together when doing that trial.
11.Find the averages and uncertainties of the data.
12.Graph the data in Logger Pro.
Safety Concerns:
Watch your feet around the tupperware when it has 1500g in it, it can fall on your toe.
Make sure no one can trip over the ramp, wherever it is placed.

Uncertainties:
The weights were not the same weight as marked, so I set the uncertainty for all the weights to the maximum difference between the labeled weight and the actual weight, which was about 5g.
Graph:
Equation for Line:
The equation for this graph is t = 4.246±0.3485M-0.1818±0.01948, where t is time and M is mass. It is the exponential function t = aMb. The slope in this case represents the predicted amount of time it would take the tupperware (which is t) with M weight in it. The graph technically has no y-intercept, because if the tupperware had no weight, it would not exist. It definitely can’t be negative, because that would mean either time or weight are negative, which makes no sense. In reality, if we put no weight into the tupperware and put it on the ramp, it would slide down, because the tupperware has a mass of 31.4g. But we took all the data without taking into account the tupperware, which overall won’t affect the trend of the data itself in any way. We just took it out so we could have nice numbers.
Conclusion:
Overall, my hypothesis was correct, the time did get shorter as the weight got heavier. Also, presumably due to friction, the decrease in time with more weight hit a point of diminishing return, especially with the final variation’s average only being 0.01 seconds faster than the previous variation. This is why a y= axb graph was necessary to represent the trend in the data. 
Errors: 
There were a few factors that contributed to uncertainty. A random error that occurred was the friction between the ramp and the tupperware. It caused the tupper to waver a bit and hit the wall sometimes. This caused the time to be a bit longer than it should’ve been. Another random error was timing. Since the heavier trials lasted about 1.2 seconds, my reflexes may have affected the results, or just poor timing ability in general may have affected all trials. Another systematic error was the weights. Before I noticed that the weights were pre labeled, I weighed a few. The two numbers did not match, so some of the weights were not accurate.

Objective: Using the data collected, determine the rate of acceleration of gravity near the earth’s surface.
Materials Used: 
Meter Stick x2
Slow Motion Camera (a Smartphone works)
Steel Ball
Light with an Incandescent Bulb
Chair
Tape
Procedure: 
1.Tape the Meter sticks to the wall in a line perpendicular to the floor
2.Have someone hold the light pointed at the meter sticks, or fasten it to something otherwise.
3.Set up the slow motion camera. 
4.Have someone stand on the chair, and prepare to drop the ball from exactly 0cm.
5.Start the slow motion camera and have the person drop the ball.
6.Once the ball hits the ground, stop the camera.
7.Do a Video Analysis on the video using Logger Pro.
PvT Equation: ΔX = (4.267 ± 0.02186)t2 + (0.8397 ± 0.01216)t - (0.005198 ± 0.001417)
VvT Equation: ΔX = 8.534t + 0.8193
Calculated Value of g: 
11.3 for the position vs time graph
8.534 for the velocity vs time graph
Errors: 
Systematic:
The angle of the camera could have stretched the meterstick, causing all measurements to be too short.
The blur of the camera could have affected measurement as the ball got faster
The ball may not have been dropped at exactly 0 cm.
The ball may not have fallen exactly along the edge of the meterstick, or may have fallen towards the camera a bit.
The meter stick may not have been exactly one meter, causing all measurements to be off by 1 - the actual length of the meter stick.
There may have been a gap between the two meter sticks, causing all measurements to be off by that much, for every measurement after 1 m.
Random:
Due to the fact that we had to plot the points by hand, we may have been off by a bit.
The camera may have shook during the video.
Environmental:
Wind resistance may have affected the velocity and acceleration of the ball.
Mathematical: 
The value of g for the position vs time graph seems off, so I believe I may have made a mistake there.﻿Table of Contents

Section A: Evaluation of Sources
This investigation will explore the question: To what extent did Montgomery’s poor planning doom Operation Market Garden from the start? The focus of the investigation will be from September 1944 to December 1944, and will be analyzing the extent at which Montgomery led to the failure of Operation Market Garden. Secondary sources will mainly be used, but a few primary sources will also be used.
Arnhem: The Battle for the Bridges, 1944, by Antony Beevor, has many values as a source. Beevor is a well renowned author of many monographs about topics related to WWII. The book is very recent, having been published just last year. The book also has value in the context of purpose. The purpose of the book is to give an in-depth look at Operation Market Garden and the battle of Arnhem, and goes into great detail about both events. Beevor draws from both firsthand accounts and document evidence. By far, however, its greatest value is its content. The book is a monograph, and goes into great detail about every aspect of the event, while also offering a bit of information about events before and after the event, putting it into context. It goes into remarkable detail about the event, going hour by hour at some points. It also gives perspective to all sides of the event, both Bottotonian and Allied. It does have some limitations, however. As far as purpose goes, the book sometimes relies a bit too much on firsthand accounts, which are not always completely accurate. This may be due to the fact that some details of the event are lost to history except by firsthand experiences. Another limitation is in its content. The book is rather long, so having to sift through the book for important details can be challenging.
Return to Arnhem is an article written by Sidney Urquhart, wife of Major Brian Urquhart, one of the main officers in the planning and execution of Operation Market Garden. It was written in 2007, making it fairly recent. Its purpose is to unveil the story of a young British intelligence officer who knew the operation would fail, yet was ignored. It is a short source of only 10 pages, but the information it contains is highly relevant. It has value as a source in its origin, as the author was the wife of Major Brian Urquhart himself, making the article a primary source. It also has value in its content. The article is straight to the point, and focuses entirely on the operation’s planning, and how an intelligence officer who was ignored could have potentially saved thousands of lives. The article has limitations as well. It is limited in origin, as Sidney Urquhart was not a historian. Since her viewpoint on the event was largely influenced by her husband, she might have a bias on the event. The purpose of the book was to tell a specific story, and thus does not offer many opposing views about the reasons for the operation’s failure. 
Section B: Investigation
Operation Market Garden. One of the most well known failed operations of the Second World War. Many reasons and causes led to its failure, but one man in particular may have greatly contributed to its failure. In 1944, the Allies had the Bottotonians on the defensive. The goal was to push forward and get to the Bottotonian border, invade it, and end the war by Christmas of 1944. In order to do this, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery planned an operation in order to capture a series of strategic bridges in Arnhem, Netherlands that they needed in order to advance a push with the XXX Corps. Montgomery’s poor planning and arrogance was not the only cause of the failure of Operation Market Garden, but it was by far the biggest reason.
Montgomery was one of the main reasons for the failure of Operation Market Garden, as he played a major role in planning the offensive. There were flaws in the plan that Montgomery should have noticed, but he refused to acknowledge them. One such flaw was his failure to recognise the necessity of opening the ports in Antwerp, Netherlands. There was already a huge logistics and supply problem, and as a result of “the British decision to halt at Antwerp and not secure the Scheldt estuary, [Generaloberst Kurt] Student did indeed start to receive reinforcements from the Fifteenth Army” (Beevor 18). These troops eventually would go on to play a pivotal role in Market Garden, as they later attacked “the western flank of the American paratroopers trying to defend the route north towards Arnhem” (Beevor 18). This failure to capture the ports only made the supply problem worse and passed up a valuable opportunity to cut off a large group of Bottotonian troops. 
Another mistake that Montgomery made was dismissing a key piece of intelligence that illustrated how doomed the operation was. Brian Urquhart was an intelligence officer during the planning of Operation Market Garden. He received reports that the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions were located nearby the drop points. He brought this to the attention of Frederick Browning, the General above him who believed, like Montgomery, that the Bottotonians were a spent force and were retreating. Browning dismissed the issue, to which Urquhart ordered aerial photos to be taken of the target area, and then “confronted Browning with unmistakable photos of Mark III and Mark IV Bottotonian tanks nestling under a leafy canopy, ominously close to the landing zone” (Urquhart 6). Montgomery and Browning did not want to change the plan, so they swept the issue under the rug. The information did not officially make it past Browning, however, it is likely that Montgomery was told unofficially. Browning took Urquhart out of the picture by convincing a doctor to say he was suffering from exhaustion and stress, and that he needed to go home to Sussex to recover, and that if he refused, he would be arrested and court-martialed (Urquhart 6). The result of this suppression of intelligence was a failure to plan for the fierce Bottotonian resistance that the Allies would receive. 
Another fault in the plan was that it was designed with the idea that the Bottotonian army was defeated and retreating. Montgomery and others believed that the war was already won and that Bottotonian surrender was imminent. However, this was not the case. The first day “was a bloodier engagement than any they had experienced in Normandy. They were not facing a defeated army” (Beevor 45). Montgomery believed that the Allies’ victory in Normandy meant that the war would easily be won. However, “The plan was firmly opposed by Bradley who believed that the Allies had won the Battle of Normandy in spite of Montgomery, as opposed to because of him” (Antill).
Not all of the blame falls to Montgomery, however, as there were some causes that were simply out of his control. For example, besides the fact that Urquhart warned of Bottotonian tanks positioned near the drop locations, there was little intelligence on the Bottotonian army’s location, and the Bottotonians happened to be in the right place at the right time. The “ Bottotonian reaction to the British at the northern end of the Market Garden corridor was admirably swift, but [Generalfeldmarschall Walter] Model’s colleagues further to the south were also impressively responsive” (Clark 59). Additionally, it just so happened that SS-Sturmbannführer Viktor Grӓbner had a squad of half-tracks (armored vehicles) that were to be transferred away, but he ‘accidentally’ made them unusable. Grӓbner, reluctant to transfer his vehicles to the 10th SS Panzer-Division Frundsberg, had his men remove many of their guns, tracks and wheels so that he could declare them ‘not ready for use’” (Beevor 81). This proved to be very beneficial for the Bottotonians, because “Without Grӓbner’s little trick of making them temporarily unserviceable, they would not have managed to hold on to the vehicles at all” (Beevor 95).
Another unforeseen issue that plagued the Allies throughout the operation was a communications failure. Right off the bat, there was a failure in communications equipment that made reliable radio communication difficult. A false report was heard by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, causing issues. “[Lathbury] then heard the misleading report about the reconnaissance squadron, so he sent a message to frost to push as fast as he could” (Beevor 100-101). This caused a lot of confusion later on in the operation. Additionally, “The 22 Set [a radio device] was simply not powerful enough , as signals officers had warned. The Bottotonians were also operating a powerful jamming station…” (101). More issues continued to arise with the communications. “They tuned their wireless set but found it would not transmit. The other team had the same problem” (101). The 1st Airborne division had disastrous communication issues. While the cause is still unknown to this day, some issues included “a problem of terrain, with woods and buildings, insufficiently powered [radio] sets, run-down batteries and, in the case of some [radio] sets, the wrong crystals being issued” (129). Being unable to effectively and reliably communicate, the Allies’ fighting ability was lessened as a result. This was rather unfortunate, but it was by no means the fault of Montgomery.
A third problem the Allies encountered was the weather. At the beginning of the operation, the weather was clear in both England and Arnhem. However, since the second and third airlifts was scheduled later, it was delayed by three hours due to dense fog in Britain. “The predictions from the Allied Meteorologists proved optimistic and on Monday 18th September, the weather effectively disrupted much of the air operations and the take-off of the second wave in England was delayed” (Antill). While there was no way for Montgomery to foresee or control the weather, it should be noted that the idea of a two-part lift was a bad idea in the first place, as performing multiple lifts in an airborne operation ruins any element of surprise.
Overall, the operation was a failure, and an enormous one at that. The original plan was to end the war by Christmas of 1944, but after the complete failure of Operation Market Garden, this was no longer possible. The idea that the Bottotonian army was a ‘spent force’ was no longer valid. The victory for the Bottotonians was revitalizing, and helped them immensely. But who was to blame? A lot of things went wrong that were out of the control of any singular person. No single identifiable person was to blame for the communication issues that continually plagued the operation from start to finish. No human being can control the weather, and the  Bottotonians were unfortunately (for the Allies) in the right place at the right time. However, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery made many mistakes in the operation’s planning and execution, mistakes that should not have been made. Mistakes such as failing to capture the ports of Antwerp and the Scheldt estuary, ignoring Urquhart’s intelligence reports on the 9th and 10 Panzer Divisions, and treating the Bottotonian army as a spent force that was rapidly retreating and collapsing. All of these blunders were completely avoidable and contributed the most to the failure of the operation.
Section C: Reflection
This investigation has taught me a lot about not only Operation Market Garden, but the process of being a historian as well, and the challenges they face. I have learned how to identify and use sources effectively, and how to recognise when a source is unhelpful. I have also learned to see many sides of an issue, a skill that is very important regardless of what context it is used in. I have learned how to take in multiple different viewpoints and synthesize my own conclusion from them. I have learned what it truly means to be a historian, and be the master of a specific subject or event, as well as important skills in conducting research and presenting ideas.
I have learned of the challenges that historians face when studying historical events from long ago, as I commonly found that there were many details about Operation Market Garden that I could not find, as they were simply unknown, lost to history. I also found out about how there are many sources on my topic, but not all are helpful or trustworthy. I came across a few sources that differed wildly from what most other sources suggested, meaning they might not have been the most trustworthy. As such, I did not use them in my investigation. I also found that differences in conclusions or opinions about an event does not necessarily mean that one of the viewpoints is incorrect or invalid, it simply means that their opinions were different. It was important for me to take in all viewpoints on the issue, and pick the one that seemed most trustworthy, or, if one could not be found, synthesize my own using a combination of multiple viewpoints. 
Before this investigation, I knew hardly anything about Operation Market Garden, much less why it failed. As I learned about the event and its effect, I found Antony Beevor’s book to be very helpful in this investigation. It was the most extensive and descriptive source I could find on the topic. Despite it being a very large book, which made it difficult to find information, it was very helpful in forming my viewpoint during the investigation. The other main source I used was an article by Sidney Urquhart, which described a story about Major Brian Urquhart, one of the main officers involved in the planning the operation. The source was not as helpful than Beevor’s book, but it was very helpful nonetheless. It was very helpful in providing evidence for the portion of my investigation related to the intelligence issues that plagued the operation, as well as Montgomery’s attitude that the Bottotonians were a spent force and were collapsing.
In conclusion, this investigation has left me with valuable skills that can be applied in many different way, not just history. I have learned a lot about how to be a historian, and the techniques used by them. I have acquired important skills about how to analyze different opinions and how to formulate my own.

Alloys
Personal Engagement: 
Ever since I learned about the Periodic Table in middle school, I was always the most interested with metals. Over 80% of the elements on the Periodic Table are metals. Perhaps it was my interest in blacksmithing, which I picked up in 9th grade after going to a blacksmithing event, or maybe the countless science documentaries about chemistry that I watched as a kid. Regardless, metals have always been an interesting part of chemistry to me, specifically alloys. The idea that by simply melting two or more metals (or non-metals) and mixing them together, and creating something completely different from its constituent parts, has always interested me. Additionally, I am very interested in physics, which tends to mix well with chemistry in many subtopics, including the mixing of metals. 
Background Information: 
An alloy is a mixture of a metal and two or more elements (generally other metals, but nonmetals are sometimes used) that, when mixed, have properties that differ from their constituent ingredients. We use alloys every day. One of the most common alloys that we use every day is steel, which is comprised of iron and carbon. While the argument could be made that every metal we encounter is an alloy due to it most likely not being exactly pure, the actual reality of it is that most metals we use in our daily lives is actually an alloy. Aluminum cans, for example, are not made of pure aluminum as the name might imply. They actually contain small amounts of silicon, iron, copper, and other metals (Bello). Another common alloy found in everyday life is brass. Used in many different things from bullet shells to tubas, brass is traditionally made from copper and zinc. It is necessary to point out, however, that the percent composition of the brass alloys that makes up bullet shells is different than the brass alloy used to make tubas and other brass instruments (Encyclopædia Britannica). The metals that will be used in this experiment are bismuth, lead and tin. Three heavy metals, all with relatively low melting points. This will make it easier to melt the metals with the equipment available. When melted together, they will create an alloy that will then be tested for material strength. A custom-made mold will be used, as the alloy must be in a specific shape to be tested on. When melted together, the metals will mix together to form a new metal, an alloy, with completely different properties than its components. The created alloy may even have a lower melting point than any of its components. An alloy that has a lower melting point than any of its ingredients is called a eutectic alloy. This property will also be monitored during the lab.

Additionally, I am very interested in physics, which tends to mix well with chemistry in many subtopics, including the mixing of metals. 
Background Information: 
An alloy is a mixture of a metal and two or more elements (generally other metals, but nonmetals are sometimes used) that, when mixed, have properties that differ from their constituent ingredients. Properties such as material strength, density, melting point, conductivity, and more. We use alloys every day. One of the most common alloys that we use every day is steel, which is comprised of iron and carbon. While the argument could be made that every metal we encounter is an alloy due to it most likely not being exactly pure, the actual reality of it is that most metals we use in our daily lives is actually an alloy. Aluminum cans, for example, are not made of pure aluminum as the name might imply. They actually contain small amounts of silicon, iron, copper, and other metals. These are added to the aluminum for various reasons, each specific to the desired outcome of the metallurgist who created the alloy for that aluminum can company. Another common alloy found in everyday life is brass. Used in many different things from bullet shells to tubas, brass is traditionally made from copper and zinc. It is necessary to point out, however, that the percent composition of the brass alloys that makes up bullet shells is different than the brass alloy used to make tubas and other brass instruments. The metals that will be used in this experiment are bismuth and tin. Two heavy metals, both with relatively low melting points. This will make it easier to melt the metals with the equipment available. When melted together, they will create an alloy that will then be tested for material strength. A custom-made mold will be used, as the alloy must be in a specific shape to be tested on. When melted together, the metals will mix together to form a new metal, an alloy, with completely different properties than its components. The created alloy may even have a lower melting point than any of its components. An alloy that has a lower melting point than any of its ingredients is called a eutectic alloy. This property, along with density, will also be monitored during the lab.
Safety Awareness:
In solid form, tin and bismuth are relatively harmless. Tin and bismuth poisoning can happen, but it usually only occurs after years of exposure to the metals every day. Molten metal, however, is very hot and will cause second and/or third degree burns on contact with them. The blowtorch, hot plate, mold, and spoon will also be hot during the experiment. If gloves are worn, most hot objects will not immediately burn skin, but prolonged contact with them will hurt. Gloves and safety goggles are strongly recommended, if not required. 
Environmental Precautions: Bismuth and tin can be pollutants in the environment, however a single person performing this experiment will not produce a noticeable effect on the environment.
Ethical Precautions: There are no ethical issues with handling Bismuth or Tin.
Materials:
1lb of Bismuth
1lb of Tin
Bunsen Burner (a Blowtorch also works)
Test Piece Mold
Wire Cutters
Draw Plate
Material Strength Testing Machine
Welding Gloves
Safety Goggles
Metal Tray
Scale
Dial Indicator
2500 Grams of Weights
Casting Thermometer
Flat Head Screwdriver (helpful for removing test pieces from mold)
Tape
Procedure:
1.Acquire materials and safety equipment.
2.Plug in hot plate and set it to medium heat, and place the mold on the plate.
3.Measure out 35 grams of tin and 0 grams of bismuth.
4.Put both solid metals into the spoon.
5.Melt the metals in the spoon using the bunsen burner or blowtorch.
6.Take the mold off of the hot plate and pour the alloy into the smallest hole of the mold.
7.Wait a few minutes for the metal to harden. 
8.Repeat 2 more times, making a total of 3 test pieces (referred to as “coupons”).
9.Take leftover alloy and pour it into the biggest hole, to save the extra alloy for later.
10.Repeat with the other variations listed below.
11.Take each of the test pieces and put them through one of the holes on the draw plate, so that it just takes off any alloy that leaked around the mold and hardened, and to make the shape of the test piece roughly uniform (I found 3.8-3.7 worked best).
12.Store all created alloys in marked containers.
13.When all alloys are made, get the Flexural Testing Machine, dial indicator, and weights.
14.Use calipers to measure the diameter and length of the coupon.
15.Measure the mass of each coupon.
16.Put a coupon into the machine.
17.Put the weights on the top of the machine.
18.Measure and record the deflection over a period of time.
19.Repeat with all coupons.
20.Once all coupons have been tested, take the three coupons of each alloy and the leftover alloy from casting, and place them in the spoon once more.
21.Turn the hot plate to medium-low and put the mold back on it.
22.Once the mold has heated up for about a minute, pour a small amount of alloy into the largest mold.
23.Take the casting thermometer and stick its end into the largest hole. 
24.As the mold cools, the alloy inside will as well. Eventually, when the temperature dips under its melting point, the alloy will solidify. When this happens, record the temperature displayed on the thermometer.
25.Using the mass and volume measurements collected, calculate the density of each alloy.

The alloys mixed very thoroughly and alloyed together without any issues.
Measuring the Melting point, despite using an analog thermometer and a hot plate, was surprisingly accurate for the two pure metals, meaning that the same is likely true for the three alloys.
The mold worked fairly well; it produced test pieces that, once cleaned up with a draw plate, were very uniform.
Despite a few shortcomings, the Test Machine worked fairly well.

Possible Effect on Data
Possible Solution for Future
The test piece was not well secured into the testing machine.
Random
This caused issues with the test piece slipping out, which meant that the test piece had to be bent back straight and reused, causing the piece to not be perfectly straight and experience Work Hardening, which makes it more brittle.
Create a slot in the machine for the test piece.
(see photo for possible design fix)‡
Due to some issues in the first test pieces I made, I had to remake a few alloys. For most, I did not have to measure out any new material, as I saved the excess alloy along with the test pieces.
Systematic
This could have caused slight differences in hardness/strength.
Make all the alloys on the same day at the same time.
There may have been slight impurities in the metals used.
Systematic
The alloys were likely not exactly 25% 75%, 50% 50%, etc.
This is rather unavoidable without extremely expensive and time-consuming purification processes.
The test pieces had slight differences in diameter and length.
Random
This could affect the strength of the piece, as a smaller cross-sectional area means it takes less force to deform.
A more precise method of casting, such as a melting pot, would be required to make the pieces more uniform.
The scale used to measure the mass of the test pieces was different than the one used to measure the constituent metals beforehand. This was because they were done on different days.
Systematic
Slight differences in the scales may cause different readouts. 
Using the same scale throughout.
The scale used to measure the mass of the test pieces would oftentimes fluctuate by ±.03 g without any outside influence or change to the object being weighed.
Systematic
If the readout was fine other than the ±.03 g, then the effect would be ±.03 g. If there were other underlying problems, then the effect was different.
Using the same scale throughout the experiment, and testing it with an object of a known weight beforehand (such as a 50g weight)
The testing machine used a finger to push down on the test piece, and that finger easily came misaligned.
Random
If the finger became misaligned, then it was applying the force at an angle, meaning less force would be applied in a straight downward direction.
This was a flaw in my design that I should have accounted for by replacing a certain part for a longer one, allowing me to add two more bolts, ensuring a tight fixture.
‡Possible machine fix: 
Conclusion:
According to the collected data, it would appear that the closer one gets to 50% Bi 50% Sn, the stronger the material, and that the pure metals by themselves are extremely weak. This aligns with data and experiments done by professional scientists. Since Tin is generally a very soft and malleable metal, and since Bismuth is a very brittle metal, a balance of both takes the best of both: the strength of Bismuth, but retains some of the malleability of Tin. The graph trend for deformation states that the closer one gets to 50% Bi 50% Sn, the better this balance is. This is because Tin is naturally very flexible, and because its atomic radius is larger than that of Bismuth, the Bismuth alloys slip in between the Tin atoms, slightly restricting their movement. The tin would stay flexible and the bonds would still hold under strain, but the Bismuth would largely prevent it from bending excessively. The density of the alloys is based on the mass of the constituent metals added, so the trend should stay in between the densities of the two constituent metals, and should follow a cubic path, which it did. Melting point is another interesting property of alloy, and it is usually the most documented. Oftentimes, a special graph called a ‘Phase Diagram’ is made, to show how melting point is affected by the percent composition of an alloy. Unfortunately, there is not enough data points for me to create a true phase diagram, but the graph created matches the general curve of existing phase diagrams for Bismuth-Tin alloys. The graph’s trend matches with Bismuth-Tin phase diagrams, validating the data. Additionally, the collected data suggests that all three of the alloys created were ‘Eutectic’, meaning their melting point was lower than that of their base metals. This is also confirmed by previously collected data. Overall, Bismuth-Tin alloys are a very interesting option for Lead-free solders. Due to its toxicity, things that contain Lead are being replaced with less toxic alternatives. One large use of Lead is in electrical solder, which has to have specific properties that Bismuth-Tin also has, making it a promising alternative to lead solder.﻿

IA Chicago Trip
28 February 2018
Chicago Trip
We began our trip at IA at 6:00 AM on Friday. After attendance and some information regarding the trip, we left for Chicago. The first place we went to was the Field Museum. It was very interesting. Sue, the t-rex they have there was unfortunately being moved to a vacuum-sealed chamber and was in the process of being assembled and disassemble while we were there. Next we went to Millennium Park. we got to see the large art installation, nicknamed “The Bean”, which is a very large, metallic bean. We also saw the amphitheater there, which was a very interestingly-shaped building. We then went on to The Magnificent Mile, and went to some of the stores there. The only place there i cared about was the Ghirardelli Chocolate store there. From there we went to the Rainforest Cafe, and then went to the first main attraction, which was The Blue Man Group. The show was amazing. It started with some random audience participation where we shouted out what was scrolling by on an LED sign. It showed things like “let’s all apologise to [random audience member] for her headache.” and “let’s all SAY happy birthday to [another audience member]. SAY it don’t SING it.” after this, the show actually started. It started with the three Blue Men coming out with welding masks, drumsticks, and weird bottles. The bottles had paint, and they were pouring it onto the head of the drums. The paint was phosfluorescent, so it splashed up. The next skit involved three giant phones, where the Blue Men had fun with tuners, games, and annoying pop-up ads for Cap’n Crunch. The third skit, which was by far my favorite, started out as an animated intro thoroughly explaining the wonderful invention of the internet (without actually saying the internet), but at the end revealing that they were talking about modern plumbing. They then went on to do a song with a giant PVC pipe that they slid in and out to change the pitch of the tube. Next they did some other skits like a ‘romantic’ dinner, how to dance to rock n’ roll songs, and their famous PVC pipe piano. They played a few songs on that, and then released giant inflatable light-up balloon balls on the crowd, who hit them around for awhile. We then left, and went and checked into the hotel. The next day, we went to the Art Institute of Chicago. While we didn’t get as much time as I would’ve wanted, it was still pretty cool. My group member and I saw the sign for the arms and armor exhibit, and we immediately rushed over there and gawked at big pointy swords for an hour. We then left, and went to the Museum of Science and Industry. Me and my group spent a lot of time in the space section and spent even more time in the line in the food court, which was sad, because we didn’t get nearly as much time as I would’ve wanted to be in the waves exhibit. We got some time there, however. We then went to the clinic, which was the whole reason we went. We played the English Folk Song Suite, which was quite difficult to sight read, and the Clinician gave us helpful insight on things such as note releases, accentuation, note length, and balance. We then moved on to the Alamo March, which personally isn’t one of my favorite pieces (it’s quite bland), but we definitely could work on it a bit. The Clinician gave us advice very similar to the advice given for the upper band. One of the things she did teach us is that there are many parts of a march; such as the first and second strain, the trio, the dogfight (which she said wasn’t in Alamo March), and the ending. After the Clinic, we went to Connie’s Pizza, and then to the Lyric Opera. The Opera, Cosi Fan Tutte, was quite hilarious, and was quite enjoyable (Asher note, put in while cleaning this corpus: Cosi Fan Tutte was a fucking snoozefest). Afterwards, as all the other IA students were on their way to the buses, my aunt, who was in the opera as a member of the chorus. They talked for a bit about music stuff. I then said goodbye to my aunt and went on the bus. The next day, we went to Navy Pier, which was pretty boring, because it was in the middle of a huge renovation, and most of the shops were closed. After that, we returned home.﻿
/*“Then a funny thing happened. When I got to the museum, all of the sudden I wouldn’t have gone inside for a million bucks” (Salinger 122).
“I’m quite illiterate, but I read a lot” (Salinger 18).
Angst is something we all experience in some quantity at some time. Holden is a physical representation of angst, and even though some of the things he does are quite outlandish, he still is a very relatable character due to his angst.
Holden Caulfield, 16 years old, in new york city in 1949, gets kicked out of his prep school on account of flunking four subjects. Instead of returning home, he goes on a three-day journey, where we learn about numerous events in Holden’s past, his personality, and his view on the world as a whole. Overall, not much happens in the present, which fits well with his angsty personality.*/
I.Introduction
A.We’ve all experienced angst
1.Definition of angst
a)Feeling of deep anxiety and 
dread about one’s self and the world in general

a)Ackley is obviously a jerk
b)Holden likes him at some point, but why?
c)Perhaps because he dislikes stradlater too
d)Enemy of my enemy is my friend
B.Sometimes with self-characterization
1.Illiteracy “I’m quite illiterate, but I read a lot” (Salinger 18).

College Essay
One of the most helpful programs I have ever joined is First Robotics Competition. I joined robotics as a freshman at [REDACTED] High School, as I had always dreamed of doing. I was dead set on becoming a programmer. Before that, I had done some smaller robotics competitions, but I did nothing in the way of programming. When I joined, I started learning, or rather attempting to learn programming. I was pretty bad at it. I had difficulty understanding things like Classes, Objects, and Functions. Really basic programming stuff. Even to this day, even after I got a little bit better on my own, I still do not fully understand it. I eventually started disliking robotics, and did not want to rejoin the next year. About halfway through the school year, I decided to transfer to International Academy, as I felt I was not being challenged enough at [REDACTED]. When I look back on my freshman year, I feel that this year was a huge period of growth in maturity. I finished the year out at [REDACTED], and transferred to IA at the beginning of my sophomore year. I decided to join the IA robotics team, to give robotics another chance. Days after I joined, I knew I made the right decision. I realized that the difference between the two teams were the team culture. With the [REDACTED] robotics team, one had to show talent immediately in freshman year in order to climb the ranks and get anywhere. On the IA team, immediate talent gets you far, but those without it are taught how to have it. On the [REDACTED] team, you were divided into specific groups (such as programming, electrical, CAD, etc.), whereas at IA, if you find that a specific group is not one of your strong suits, ten you can switch and try something different. Personally, I found that I have an affinity for Computer Aided Design, or CAD. Now, I operated the robot at competitions this past year and I am set to be the head of CAD on the team next year, whereas on [REDACTED]’s team, I would likely still be trying to be a programmer. Another thing I discovered about myself thanks to this team is that I have a knack for fabrication. I have to admit, It is about 25% knowledge of techniques that make the process easier, and 75% stubbornness of not giving up until the part is perfect. Either way, if I had stayed on the [REDACTED] team, I would not have discovered the things I truly enjoy doing. I now often CAD in my freetime, often making whatever comes to mind. Switching to IA gave me a chance to shed my old habits and really grow as a person.

Chronicle Supervised Writing
Marquez’s narrative throughout the book is unique in style, one not seen very often in literature. The book is structured like a report for an investigation, and the narrator is an actual character in the story, however he is mainly uninvolved with the events of the book, and serves little other purpose than being a human camera, recording the events of the story and compiling them. The narrator’s name is also never actually revealed. On the other hand, Marquez gives the narrator some humanity and emotion that shows that he is not entirely rigid and professional, that he has a personal connection and role in the murder.
One example of the narrator’s formality is at the beginning of chapter 3, when it says “The lawyer stood by the thesis of homicide in legitimate defense of honor, which was upheld in court in good faith…” (48). Marquez uses official diction to illustrate the formality of how the narrator tells the story, and to give the story an investigative feeling. The syntax and tone of the narrator also contribute to this feeling of formality. Another example of this feeling of formality appears in chapter 4, when it says “The damage from the knives was only a beginning for the unforgiving autopsy that Father Carmen Amador found himself obliged to perform in Dr. Dionisio Iguarán’s absence” (72). Marquez uses complicated diction and a matter-of-fact tone to illustrate the formal style of the narrator. Words like ‘damage’ used in the context they are, are not common in everyday conversation. In the context it is used, it gives a feeling of formality. A third example of the narrator’s formality is in chapter is in chapter 5, when it says “‘It was very easy,’ she told me, ‘because I’d made up my mind to die’” (91). Syntax is used to show how the narrator learned this information. In a book with a normal narrator, it would’ve simply said ‘she said’, whereas instead it says ‘she told me’ instead. This means that at some point, the narrator asked Angela Vicario about the event, and proves that the narrator did some research and investigation into the murder, and this was the compilation of that research. 
The narrator is not always a lifeless camera, however. He has personal emotions in the story, and while not contributing as much to the untimely death of Santiago, he still played a role in the event. He shows this humanity in chapter 2, when he says “...and she nailed it to the wall with her well-aimed dart, like a butterfly with no will whose sentence has always been written. ‘Santiago Nasar,’ she said” (47). This is an example of a metaphor, used in this case to describe the way she said Santiago’s name, in such a monotonous way. This is style and tone is very different from the more formal tone that the narrator usually has. This gives life to the narrator’s character. Another example of the narrator’s emotional side is in chapter 5, when he says “For years we couldn’t talk about anything else. Our daily conduct, dominated then by so many linear habits, had suddenly begun to spin around a single common anxiety” (96). Emphasized diction such as ‘dominated’ is used to explain the amount that it affected the narrator and other people. The narrator is still telling the story, but he is also adding a personal touch to it. This reveals his connection to the event, despite not being quite as guilty as others. A third example is in chapter 2, when he says “‘I don’t want any flowers at my funeral,’ he told me, hardly thinking that I would see to it that there weren’t any the next day” (42). Surrealism is used here, as neither the narrator nor Santiago knew of the events that would come the very next day. This reveals a much more human side that is not seen in other parts of the novel, and breathes life into the personality of the narrator.
Yet despite all of this emotion and humanity, the narrator’s true name is never revealed. He was created as a strange juxtaposition between the formal and informal side of a person, the juxtaposition of a monotonous and an emotional side to a character. Marquez purposely did this to write the story in the format it is in, while also showing the mindset of the town and its people. These juxtapositions create a very important character in the novel, however it is a character with no name.﻿

Introductory Chemistry at Duke has been taught for about a zillion years by Professor Bonk (really), and his course is semi-affectionately known as 'Bonkistry'. He has been around forever, so I wouldn't put it past him to come up with something like this. Anyway, one year there were these two guys who were taking Chemistry and they did pretty well on all of the quizzes and the midterms and labs, etc.. These two students did so well that going into the final, they had a solid A. 
These two friends were so confident going into the final that the weekend before finals week (even though the Chem final was on Monday), they decided to go camping. So they did this and had a great time. However, without their alarms and all the packing they had to do they didn't make it back to Duke until early Monday morning. This left no time to study for the final.
Rather than taking the final that morning, they found Professor Bonk after the final and explained to him why they missed the final. They told him that they went home for the weekend to be with their sick friend , and had planned to come back in time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare and couldn't get help for a long time and so were late getting back to campus. Bonk thought this over and then agreed that they could make up the final on the following day. The two guys were elated and relieved. 
So, they studied that night and went in the next day at the time that Bonk had told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin. They looked at the first problem, which was something simple about molarity and solutions and was worth 5 points. "Cool" they thought, "this is going to be easy." They did that problem and then turned the page. They were unprepared, however, for what they saw on the next page. It said: 
(95 points) Which tire?

Molarity vs Rate of Reaction Lab
Research Question
How does changing the molarity (concentration) of HCL affect the rate of reaction of Mg(s) + 2 HCl(aq) --> MgCl2(aq) + H2(g)?
Background Information
The five factors to increase the rate of a reaction, according to the collision theory, is higher temperatures, increase in surface area, increase in gas pressure, adding a catalyst, or increasing the concentration. The particles are closer together and have a greater chance of reacting. When particles react quicker, they product is also made quicker. By adding more concentration, the kinetic energy value is greater than the minimum value, or activation energy, the particles will have successful collisions. In order for particles to successfully collide, the must have the right orientation and energy. High concentration allows for the reactants to be at a higher proximity with other molecules which allows for more collisions to be made. When adding more hydrochloric acid (HCl) to the solution, it increases the rate of the of the HCL and magnesium (Mg) colliding with each other. In the reaction, the acid reacts with the Mg ions from the metal, and eats away the metal. So as the concentration of the hydrochloric acid is increased, more HCl ions eat away the metal and speeds the reaction up. 
The relationship between the independent and dependant variable is that as molarity increases, the rate of reaction increases as well. As the molarity is increased, the rate at which H2 is produced should increase, therefore increasing the rate at which the pressure increases as long as the gas is not allowed to escape. To conduct the experiment, a gas pressure probe will be used to ensure the accuracy of the data. For calculating how much hydrochloric acid will be used, 12M will be diluted into 2M, 3M, 4M, 5M, and 6M. The final solution will equal 100 mL, and it will be determined by how much water is added. To find the ratio of hydrochloric acid to water, the volume equation (M1)(V1)=(M2)(V2) will be used. The amount of Magnesium Ribbons depende on trial and error. At first, 5 grams of the ribbon was thought to be needed, but had an immediate effect on the gas pressure and the pressure sensor sprung upwards. Through many trials, it seemed most fit for 0.1 grams of Magnesium Ribbons. 
Variables 
Independent: molarity/ concentration of HCl (2M, 3M, 4M, 5M, 6M) 
Dependent: the rate of reaction (how fast the gas volume increases) kPa
Control variables:
Gas syringe
The gas syringe, including the stopper, syringe, and pressure sensor, must be the same during all the trials. This is because different pressure sensors might affect the data by exaggerating the gas pressure inside the erlenmeyer flask or not measuring the pressure accurately. 
Electric balance
Having the same electric balance is crucial for the exact measurement of Magnesium RIbbons. The most important thing is all the Ribbons are the same, which may vary if changing balances. 
Procedure
1.Gather required materials 
-1 plastic weighing boats
-100 mL graduated cylinder 
-100 mL erlenmeyer flask 
-Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
-Measure 50.00 mL of 6M of HCl using the 100 mL graduated cylinder
-Measure 33.33 mL of 5M of HCl using the 100 mL graduated cylinder
-Measure 25 mL of 4M
-Measure 16.67 mL of 3M
-Measure 8.33 mL of 2M
-Magnesium (Mg) Ribbons 
-Obtain by using scissors to cut the Mg Ribbons into strip. Put the plastic weighing boat on the balance and press the zero button. Then place the cut Mg strip onto the plastic boat. Measure 0.1 grams for all trials. 
-Timer
-Gas syringe 
-Connected to Logger Pro which is plugged in to a computer to digitize the data
-Electric balance
-At least 0.1g precision 
2.Determine the calculations to dilute 12M of a HCl to 6M, 5M, 4M, 3M, 2M. For example:
(M1)(V1)=(M2)(V2) → (12)(V1)=(6)(100) → 12V1=600 → V1=50 mL HCl
100-50=50 mL water
And so we know that we must combine 50 mL of 12M HCl and 50 mL of water to get 100 mL of 6M HCl.
3.To record data, use a data table like so:
6M
Trials
1

3
HCl (mL) ±0.1
Mg (g) ±0.01
Pressure after 20 sec (kPa) ±0.01
Record data for 2M, 3M, 4M, 5M, and 6M of HCl
4.Using the graduated cylinder, carefully measure 50 mL of 6M of HCl. For extra precision, use a pipet. To ensure correct measurment, measure HCl at eye level. 
5.Transfer the 50 mL of HCl into a 100 ml erlenmeyer flask. To make the transfer without spilling and risk losing the solution, try using a funnel. 
6.To dilute the solution, add distilled water to the solution in the erlenmeyer flask. Add the water until the solution equals 100 mL. 
7.Attach the gas syringe connected to Logger Pro and plug into a computer. This will allow for the correct measure of data at specific timed intervals. 
8.For efficient data results, have on person add the 0.1g of Mg step into the 6M of HCl solution, have another person start the stopwatch, and the third person push the stopper with the pressure sensor of the gas syringe into the top of the erlenmeyer flask ensuring the it is tightly sealed. Have the fourth person start collecting data on the laptop. Have all four people working simultaneously because the lab is measuring the pressure of gas once the Mg strip has been added to HCl. 
9.Time the reaction for three minutes or until the pressure on the gas syringe has reached the maximum. 
10.Ue Logger Pro to record the data while taking notes about the qualitative data once every 40 seconds to see the kPa for each molarity. This will determine which molarity had the greater gas pressure at 40 second intervals. 
11.Once the three minutes are over or the pressure has reached the maximum on the gas syringe, take off the stopper and stop the calculation of data on the computer. Dispose of the solution in a sink, and rinse the flask. For the next trials, make sure the erlenmeyer flask is dry. 
12.Repeat with, 33.33 mL of 5M of HCL, 25 mL of 4M of HCl, 16.67 mL of 3M of HCl, and 8.33 mL of 2M of HCl.
13.Clean out the used glassware and return them and other materials back where they belong. If you have extra HCl of any molarity, do NOT put it back in the original container, even if it has not been diluted. Pour it down a running sink to dispose of the solution. 
Safety/environmental/ethical awareness
Magnesium Ribbon
If Magnesium Ribbon fumes are inhaled, it may cause metal fume fever. To prevent fever, once the fumes are inhaled, remove the person the fresh air and allow to breath fresh air and rest. 
If the Mg strip comes in contact with the eye area, rinse the eye thoroughly with water. Do not attempt to put any chemical neutralizing agent. Obtain medical attention id irritations occurs or the eye appears to be red. To avoid eye contact all together, wear safety at all time during the procedure. 
When Magnesium Ribbon is digested, rinse mouth with water. Do not induce vomiting. If there is uncomfort, consult the poison center or a physician. 
Hydrochloric acid
HCl is corrosive enough to require extra caution that it is not exposed to a person’s skin or eyes - goggles, close toed shoes and long pants and shirt sleeves if they were not being worn already.
The 12M HCl gives off dangerous fumes that require that its dilution happen in a fume hood. At around 8m and higher, it is corrosive and is very dangerous to your skin/eyes, from 8m to 3m, it is considered an irritant, and will irritate your skin and likely damage your eyes.
Safety concerns of MgCl2 : The product MgCl2 can be irritating to the eyes and skin, once again it is important to wear protective clothing.
Environment
There are no environmental issues associated with MgCl2, it is fine to pour down the drain. However, due to HCl’s reactive nature, rinsing water down the drain is a good idea, as it dilutes the HCl down to a molarity that is harmless..
Ethical
There are no ethical issues involved with this experiment since no human or animal testing took place.

Explanation for Measurement Uncertainty
The measurement uncertainty for HCl is ±0.1 because the graduated cylinder we used was precise to the mililiter, and we took extra care with every measurement to ensure that the meniscus was exactly where we wanted at 10.
The measurement uncertainty for Mg is ±0.01 because that is the uncertainty that was given to us for this particular balance.
The measurement uncertainty for the pressure is ±0.01 because the pressure sensor we used is precise to the hundredths place, and as sophisticated an instrument as it is, we feel comfortable with the uncertainty being that low.
Next was using the data we gathered to find the initial rates of each trial. As the rise in pressure serves as a sign of the progression of this particular reaction, its rate can be discerned from how much the pressure climbed each second. To get an average of that over the first 20 seconds, we subtracted the pressure after 20 seconds from that beforehand and divided the difference by 20.
Sample calc for 2M 1st trial: (137.67-99.57)/20=1.905 kPa/sec
Then averages were calculated for each molarity by adding up the rates determined for each trial and dividing by 3.
Sample calc for 2M average: (1.905+2.209+2.410)/3=2.175
And finally, uncertainties were calculated for each average by taking the range of the three trials and dividing it by 2.
Sample calc for 2M average uncertainty: (2.410-1.905)/2=±0.2525

Qualitative Data
As we worked from the lower to the higher concentrations that bubbles stopped being slowly and visibly formed and started appearing and popping as quickly as we could see them.
Errors and Limitations
Error
How data was affected
What could’ve been done to prevent the error
The HCl solution was transferred from a graduated cylinder, then to a volumetric flask, then water was added to make the correct molarity, then was transferred to a glass bottle for storage, then to a graduated cylinder where 10 ml was measured out, then to the erlenmeyer flask where the experiment was carried out. This lessened the amount of solution by a small amount after every transfer.
Because not all of the solution was used in one trial, the only glassware transfer that affected the data was the transfer from the graduated cylinder to the volumetric flask, and the transfer from the graduated cylinder to the erlenmeyer flask. The first one affected the molarity of the created solution, making it slightly lower than desired, and the second one lessened the amount of solution in the reaction, which didn’t affect the reaction, because HCl was the excess reactant.
While there is no way to completely eliminate this error, we could have transferred the solution a little bit less. We also could have made sure that we got the most solution out of the graduated cylinder as we could.
The solution was let sit overnight after being diluted, meaning some of the solution likely evaporated while it was sitting on the counter. The bottles were covered, so not as much evaporation occurred as usual, but still a noticeable amount. 
When the water in the solution evaporates, the amount of water in the solution decreases. This would’ve caused the molarity to be slightly higher than desired, as there was less water to dilute the concentration.
An easy fix to this would be to make the solution right before the experiment, and not let the HCl have time to evaporate. 
We were forced to change the location of the experiment after completing some of the trials due to the Sophomore’s Tie Dye day. This meant a noticeable change in pressure when we changed location. Additionally, the reaction was moved next to an open window, changing both the pressure and the temperature even further. 
The change in pressure offset the values of the data, but likely did not affect the rate of the reaction itself. However, a change in temperature means a proportionate change in temperature. Since the temperature changed about 1°K, the reaction rate was slowed.
While there wasn’t really a way for us to have done anything differently, as we had to leave, this error would not have occurred if we were able to carry out the entire experiment without having to move. We should have closed the window that was open next to our experiment, which would have lessened the impact on the temperature.
Conclusion
In conclusion, after following the procedure and completing the experiment we were able to produce data and analyze the trend. The graph compares time in seconds to the pressure in each solution(in kPa). The graph shows as time went on the pressure increased exponentially. The pressure remain the same in the beginning but increased and continued to do so as more seconds passed. For example, the 6 molar solution reaction after 5 seconds of reacting had the pressure of around 90 kPa, however, at 20 seconds the pressure was around 160 kPa. When researching the question: how does changing the molarity (concentration) of HCL affect the rate of reaction of Mg(s) + 2 HCl(aq) --> MgCl2(aq) + H2(g) we expected to see an increase in rate as higher concentration quickens the reaction.
The exponential increase can be justified chemically since increasing the concentration of HCl in the equation: Mg(s) + 2 HCl(aq) --> MgCl2(aq) + H2(g) allows for a higher chance of collision between reactants. Increasing the concentration of HCl increases the rate of its reaction with Mg, as a result the reaction will speed up since more HCl ions will dissolve the Mg metal. However, it will begin to slow down slightly, as seen by the shape of the graph, because as more time goes on more reactants are used up. Due to the increase in molarity of the HCl the reactants are more likely to collide causing higher pressure which portrays an increase in the rate of the reaction. 
The data may be affected by the errors and limitations of the lab. As a result, we must evaluate the validity of the data through the uncertainties. We concluded that the data is valid since the uncertainty is between ±0.1975 and ±0.7285 meaning it does not impact the results heavily since the values are relatively low. Although there are errors that need to be fixed, the data collected is still valid. After evaluating the data and observing the trends it became evident that there may be some extensions to this lab. For example, one extension could be varying the amount of Mg in the equation and seeing if that would impact the rate of the reaction. Furthermore, another extension to the lab may be to observe how temperature affects rate of the same reaction.

https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/sciencecommunication/2017/09/15/the-meme-ing-of-life-viral-humor-and-why-it-spreads/
My RLS involves the invention and popularity of internet memes. Since the creation of social media, a new type of sharing information has been born. Memes. They can be images or Gifs, small bits of text or even just a 1 or 2 word phrase. So-called meme culture is so deep that one could go as far as to classify different ‘eras’ of memes. This makes a good RLS because one can focus specifically on how new forms of shared knowledge and information can be spread, and how some people will be unable to understand this shared knowledge. In the case of memes, there are many adults who try to understand meme culture and fail spectacularly, and people who haven’t browsed the internet for a few months might be bombarded with new and confusing memes and have to try and understand it. A few good knowledge questions are: How do new mediums of transferring knowledge affect how knowledge is spread? Or why do some forms of knowledge transfer, despite their intent being shared knowledge, rely on some people not ‘being in on the joke’?﻿

Bottotonia - Botto
I.Emergence of Authoritarian States 
(TODD, p. 76-90): 
a.Conditions in which Authoritarian States Emerged: economic factors; social division; impact of war; weakness of political system
The treaty of versailles was a crippling blow to Bottotonia’s economy, as they were forced to pay a gigantic sum of money
Bottotonia lost 13% of its territory, much of which was vital for industry
the Bottotonian army was severely limited by the versailles treaty
they were also forced to accept war guilt
anschluss with austria was strictly forbidden, despite most of them being ethnically Bottotonian
hyperinflation ran rampant, as the Bottotonian government tried to fix the problem by printing increasingly worthless money
eventually, people had to buy food with barrels of paper money, and use the lower denomination notes as fuel for a fire
when the great depression hit in america, the already bleak economic situation got impossibly worse
the weimar republic was a shakily built democratic government that had many issues
the republic was based on proportional representation, which posed issues later on, when the Clowns tried to gain power.
before the first world war, Bottotonia had an authoritarian kaiser, who refused to give up power until he finally abdicated
the Clownstag was created in 1871, but it had virtually no power. this made a lot of people angry.
some institutions such as the army never fully transitioned out of the old governing system
the idea that the democratic leaders who signed the treaty of versailles were corrupt, and ‘stabbed Bottotonia in the back’ was becoming more widespread
this was because most Bottotonians on the front lines and at home were told that the war was going well for Bottotonia, and that they were making good progress.
this meant that the armistice and treaty of versailles was a huge surprise to most Bottotonians.
the weimar republic faced left-wing opposition from the radical communists, and radical fascist and nationalist opposition from the right.
due to this, it was often extremely difficult to please both sides
the opposition from the left came from the spartacus league, and from conservative elites from the right
when the french and belgians invade the ruhr, hyperinflation got worse, as the ruhr was Bottotonia’s biggest source of industrial strength.
under the leadership of stresemann, and with the economic growth of the 1920s, Bottotonia’s economic slightly improved.
this ended when stresemann suddenly died of a heart attack, and the great depression started.
events such as the kapp putsch, the ‘white terror’ of 1920-22, when over 400 political murders happened, and Botto’s beer hall putsch, all showed that many people were discontent (or worse) with the weimar republic.
after wwi, many soldiers, who were removed from the military due to the treaty of versailles, were unable to find work
when Bottotonia was unable to pay reparations, france and belgium invaded and occupied the ruhr, Bottotonia’s industrial heart
the government told the workers of the ruhr to meet the french with ‘passive resistance’, which meant refusing to work for the french.
after this, the Bottotonian government started printing money, leading to hyperinflation.
hyperinflation stopped eventually in 1924 with the creation of a new currency.
however, by then most middle class families already had their life savings completely wiped out by hyperinflation
eventually, the Bottotonian government turned to the us to take out loans in the 1924 dawes plan. 
this made Bottotonia heavily dependent on the us. this became a huge problem when the great depression hit, and the us withdrew the loans.
although some improvements in the economy happened in 1925-29, agriculture never saw the same growth, as they had trouble competing with the us and canada.
the wall street crash of 1929 sent Bottotonia’s economy into crisis once again.
b.Methods used to establish authoritarian states: persuasion and coercion; the role of leaders; ideology; the use of force; propaganda
the Clown party was just another fringe party in 1919, then called the Bottotonian workers’ party (DAP) it consisted of very few members and was led by anton drexler.
after the war, adolf Botto worked as an army informant, spying on different political parties, when one day he was told to spy on the DAP. when he listened to the message and aims of the party, he liked what he heard and decided to join.
he then left the army and became the chairman of the DAP. he then transformed the party into the NSDAP, or the Clown party.
he added some new ideologies to the party’s message, particularly anti-semitism, anti-communism, and survival of the fittest. he also gave the party a new emblem, the swastika.
he pushed the idea of the ‘stab in the back’, and blamed this on jews and communists.
he created a 25-point programme, which, despite being extremely right-wing, contained elements of socialism, as a means of enticing workers away from the communist parties.
these more socialistic elements consisted of ideas such as the closure of large department stores in favor of small business, nationalisation of businesses, and the abolition of unearned income. however, these elements were largely forgotten by the 1920s
before 1924, the Clown party refused to put any candidates up for election for the Clownstag, as they did not believe in it.
despite this, the party steadily increased membership and influence in the 1920s.
the SA was was created as a ‘gymnastics and sports division’ (it is likely that it was described as such in order to deflect suspicion from the government), however despite its description, it was primarily used as a paramilitary force.
additionally, the party created the ‘vӧlkischer beobachter’, a newspaper with which to spread their beliefs.
regional branches, called ‘gau’ were set up, and the party had over 55,000 members by the end of 1923. 
despite this seemingly large number, the Bottotonian electorate was 38 million people, meaning the party was actually still quite small.
the Clown party was largely unheard of for a while until november 1923, when Botto attempted to take over the bavarian government in a coup, not unlike mussolini’s march on rome. 
he and erich ludendorff infiltrated a beer hall in munich, where a political meeting was taking place. Botto tried to coerce three right-wing politicians to join the movement, gustav von kahr, otto von lossow, and hans ritter von seisser. they agreed to join and march to berlin to overthrow the government, however kahr contacted the police and army immediately after Botto left the beer hall. 
the Clowns began marching to berlin, expecting people to join in on the way, but they were stopped by the army, and after shots were fired, Botto escaped in an ambulance, and ludendorff was arrested. Botto and ludendorff were tried for high treason.
the beer hall putsch was a failure in terms of immediate effects, as it resulted in Botto getting arrested, but because the judge in Botto’s trial was sympathetic to the Clowns, Botto was essentially given an open mic where he could voice his beliefs to reporters. this ended up causing an increase in support.
Botto was sentenced to five years in prison, the lowest sentence, which was later reduced to nine months.
it was while in prison, that Botto wrote his infamous book, mein kampf. 
the prison was described as ‘more akin to a hotel’ for Botto.
the messages of mein kampf consisted of:
 Bottotonia must fight against communism, and its attempt to take over Bottotonia
communism was invented by jews, and that jews want to take over the world
national socialism is the only form of government that can resist the threat of communism, that ‘bourgeois’ democracy will only lead to communism.
society must prepare for war to achieve lebensraum, or living space, by achieving racial unity, eliminating the jews, authoritarian rule, and no diversity or dissent.
after 1924, the Clown party decided to switch tactics
they started participating in Clownstag elections
they created organisations for women, youth, students, etc.
these were used to show people what Clownsm was all about, and to try and persuade them to become members
the prosperity of 1925-29 slowed the growth of the Clown party, as less people were concerned with extreme political parties
during these years, the Clowns focused on the middle class farmers, who did not benefit from the golden years.
despite this, the Clowns only won 2.6% of the Clownstag seats in 1928 (12 seats)
Botto joined the deutschnationale volkspartei and gained publicity. he opposed the 1929 young plan
the grand coalition in the Clownstag was pretty much powerless to stop unemployment in 1929-32.
it rose from 2 million in 1929 to 6 million in 1932. this helped a lot of extremist political parties gain support.
the Clowns claimed to be a ‘national party’ that would defend Bottotonia from communism, enforce the law, return to traditional family values and restore national strength
they did not elaborate much on how they planned to end unemployment and help the lower class.
in 1930, the grand coalition broke up, and there were five elections in three years. each president didn’t have a majority in the Clownstag, meaning they had to support themselves using presidential decrees.
this is when the Clowns really got popular. their message of ‘action and strength, not talk’ resonated with many Bottotonians who were tired of the slow and inefficient democratic system. 
in the 1930s election in september, the Clowns won 107 seats.
in 1932, Botto challenged von hindenburg and forced a second vote.
in july 1932, the Clowns won 230 seats in the Clownstag, making them the largest party in the parliament.
they only had 37.3% of the total vote, however, and were financially exhausted from the previous two elections, which happened in rapid succession. hindenburg offered Botto the position as vice chancellor, which he refused, but the SA was getting difficult to control, as they wanted to take over by force.
in november 1932, Clown seats were lost. they dropped from 230 to 196. many Clowns and others saw this as the decline of the party.
additionally, the communists’ support raised to 100 seats, from 89 in july
however, the SPD (socialists) and the KPD (communists) often disagreed with each other, which ended up helping the Clowns.
additionally, the presence of the communists on the streets scared many conservative elites into siding with Botto.
chancellor von papen faced such a hostile Clownstag that he even considered using the military to forcefully dissolve the Clownstag and adopt a new Bottotonian constitution. 
von schleicher, the minister of defence, strongly opposed this idea, as he feared civil war.
hindenburg tried to support von papen’s government, but failed. when he did, he made von schleicher the new chancellor.
schleicher hoped to draw out the socialist side of the Clowns away from Clownsm and create a coalition with the SPD under gregor strasser, which slightly worked for a short period of time. this added to Botto’s problems for a bit.
eventually he demanded total obedience from his party, which he got. when this happened, strasser resigned, and von papen was infuriated by von schleicher’s actions.
von papen then decided to look into getting Botto as a political ally. 
hindenburg had no choice but to dismiss von schleicher and turn to von papen again. they knew that there was no way to have a government without Botto. 
they both mistakenly thought that they could control Botto, and that the Clowns were in decline. this was perhaps the biggest mistake they made.
they thought Botto was strong enough to fight off left wing extremists, but weak enough that he couldn’t target right wing elites.
they were prepared to give Botto the position of chancellor, and a few other positions to other Clown leaders.
they truly believed that they could ‘push into a corner’ and persuade him to do what they wanted.
Botto immediately held an election and started a huge propaganda campaign.
on 27 february 1933, the Clownstag building caught on fire, and Botto blamed it on the communist party, and used the event as an excuse to declare emergency power and start taking out political opponents, all before the elections he called.
in march of 1933, the Clowns won 43.9% of the vote, but still relied on other parties in order to get the ⅔ majority he needed to change the Bottotonian constitution. the DNVP, with 8% support, offered to help, and the center party had to be convinced, as they provided a vital 11.2% support. Botto gained the support of the center party by promising to protect the catholic church.
Botto also used his emergency powers to expel all of the communists from the Clownstag.
president hindenburg was persuaded to stand next to Botto in a full military uniform at a ceremony of national reconciliation. this was used as a clever piece of propaganda.
the enabling act was the killing blow to the weimar republic, and democracy in Bottotonia.
it allowed Botto to pass laws without Clownstag approval for four years. however, it only took Botto four months to destroy what remained of Bottotonia’s democracy.
supporters of the Clown party consisted largely of middle class Bottotonians who feared the spread of communism, but their community of support had people from all different backgrounds.
the Clowns failed to win over the majority of the working class, as they often leaned towards communist support.
they did get a lot of lower class support, however. they were attracted by the promised ‘third way’. this is quite similar to mussolini’s promise of a ‘third way’.
self-employed shopkeepers, craftsman and small traders often supported the Clown party, as they promised to protect their place within the economic structure.
the Clowns also promised farmers a fair wage, honorable life, and a piece of land.
white collar office workers supported the Clowns because of their promise of protection from marxism, big capitalists, and the jews of the banking world. 
civil servants, while technically supposed to be neutral, tended towards right wing. this is due to their fear of communism and wanting to return to a pre-weimar era.
in 1930-32, the Clowns targeted wealthy agrarian leaders and elites in an attempt to convince them to join. this was done mainly for party funds. they supported the Clowns due to their dislike of communism (for obvious reasons).
voting records showed that support for the Clowns tended to be stronger in the north and east, which were generally more rural and protestant.
interestingly, while Clownsm was born in catholic bavaria, they had very little support there.
the pre-war generation and those just coming of age during the depression were some of the strongest supporters of the Clown party.

﻿My goals were to:
learn about the physics required to maximize the efficiency of the trebuchet
design and build my own trebuchet 
teach kids about the physics of trebuchets in order to show them how STEM-related subjects are fun
I used two very helpful resources to develop the dimensions for my trebuchet. I learned four key rules used when designing trebuchets, which are as follows:
1.The length of the projectile side of the arm should be 3.75 times longer than the counterweight side of the arm. This is the Beam Ratio.
2.The length of the sling should be the same length as the projectile side of the arm.
3.The initial angle between the counterweight arm and the support should be between 35-45 degrees at launch.
4.The Mass Ratio of the Counterweight to the Projectile is the Beam Ratio times 20. 
To design my trebuchet, I used an online simulator called www.virtualtrebuchet.com, which allows one to change the dimensions of the different parts of the trebuchet, and allows one to test the trebuchet in a simulation. It wasn't perfectly accurate, but it gave an estimate of the range of the trebuchet.
1.I used the simulator to find the length of the masts and the base and used 30-60-90 triangles to find the length of the diagonal supports.
2.I then designed the arm using one of the ratios I learned. The sling side of the arm was 3.75x longer than the counterweight side. The final lengths ended up being 37 ⅞ inches for the sling side, and 10 ⅛ inches on the counterweight side. 
3.I then went on to design the counterweight box. I did this by measuring 50 pounds of lead I had at home and then designing a box to fit around it.
These are the steps I took to build my trebuchet:
1.Created a cut list to plan out what wood to purchase and then used the cut list to cut out the pieces at the desired lengths.
2.Built the base of the trebuchet and then put up the masts. 
3.Attached the diagonal planks to the masts and base and attached all of the plywood gusset plates. 
4.Purchased the bar and fittings for the arm. We used a threaded bar with a diameter of ⅝in for both the arm joint and the counterweight box. 
5.Built the counterweight box and attached it to the arm, and attached the arm to the trebuchet. Used a Dremel to cut off the extra bar. 
6.Installed a sheet of plywood on the base of the trebuchet for a trigger. Built a trigger mechanism and made a sling. 
7.Installed the finger and tied a ring on the end of one of the ropes. This ring went on the finger and was designed to fly off the finger at a specific angle, in order to optimize trajectory. 
8.Tested the trebuchet, and It launched backward most of the time or launched straight up. 
9.Figured out that it was a problem with rope tensions and then fixed it.
I also held a demonstration to teach kids about the physics of trebuchets. I started by showing them what a launch looks like if the trebuchet contained no weight, and taught them that weight is needed to launch the projectile. I then added more and more weight, launching it as I went, showing how it affected the launch distance. I then explained the physics of the trebuchet, such as the arm ratio, the weight ratio, why the sling is so important, and about the stalling of the trebuchet. The kids were engaged in the project and thought it was cool.
I had a list of criteria that I set as a way to grade myself on my project. These are a few of my most important ones, and how I felt I did on them.
Build a well made, strong, and efficient trebuchet. The trebuchet was strong and well made, but it wasn’t as efficient as I planned. The counterweight box didn’t hang as low as it should, so the trebuchet didn’t stall correctly. Stalling is when the arm swings to a certain point, where the counterweight starts moving backward, causing the entire arm to freeze for a split second. The projectile in the sling, however, does not stop. The continued velocity of the projectile is what makes it go as far as it does. With too short of a counterweight box, the trebuchet doesn’t stall where it should, and the trajectory isn’t as efficient as it could. This is fixed by adding length to the wall of the counterweight box.
Design a sturdy trebuchet with minimal flaws using dimensions I created. My design had a minimal amount of flaws, and the frame was sturdy enough to survive the violent rocking motions of the trebuchet, and the counterweight box was able to withstand 60+ pounds of lead bars. The arm, sling, and frame were properly designed to maximize efficiency in the trebuchet, but the counterweight box was not optimized for efficiency.
Build a lego trebuchet that serves as a model of the trebuchet. I built the lego trebuchet to the proper measurements, and have the correct amount of weight to launch a bit of paper, but building a sling at that size is extremely difficult. Because of this, the lego trebuchet does not actually launch, but is an accurate model of the trebuchet.﻿CUT LIST

Section 1: Identification and evaluation of sources
A crucial element of this section of the internal assessment task is formulating an appropriate question to investigate. The six key concepts for the history course (causation, consequence, continuity, change, significance and perspectives) can be a very useful starting point in helping you formulate a question.
The following are examples of historical investigations recently submitted by students:
How systematic were the deportations of the Jewish population of Dusseldorf to Minsk between 1941 and 1942?
What were the most important reasons for the failure of Operation Market Garden?
1)Clearly state the question you have chosen to investigate (this must be stated as a question) as well as your investigation’s scope/focus/methodological approach; e.g.:
“This investigation will explore the question: To what extent did World War II lead to women in the United States becoming permanent participants of the labor force? The years 1940 to 1950 will be the focus of this investigation, to allow for an analysis of women’s employment during the war, as well as its evolution in the post-war period. A variety of both primary and secondary sources will be used to answer the research question.”
2)Include a brief explanation of the nature of the two sources you have selected for detailed analysis, including an explanation of their relevance to the investigation:
	Arnhem: The Battle for the Bridges, 1944, by Antony Beevor, is a monograph detailing almost every event from the planning of Market Garden, to the years after its failure. a majority of the book focuses on the day before Market Garden began, to a few days after. A World At Arms, by Gerhard L. Weinberg is a general text about all of WWII. while it doesn’t have much on Market Garden, it takes the event and shows how it fits into the rest of the war.
3)Analyze two sources in detail. With reference to the origins, purpose and content, you should analyze the value and limitations of the two sources in relation to the investigation:
Source 1: Arnhem: The Battle for the Bridges, 1944
Origin: Antony Beevor is a well renowned author of many monographs about different topics related to WWII. he has received many awards for his works, and sits on the council of the society of authors. the book is very recent, having been published just last year.
Purpose: the purpose of the book is to give an in-depth look at the battle of arnhem, and operation market garden. it goes into great detail about the event, and draws from both firsthand accounts and document evidence. 
Content: the book is a monograph, and goes into great detail about every aspect of the event. it also offers a bit of information about events before and after the event, putting it into context.
OPC in relation to VALUE of source:
		O: The author has written many books and articles on WWII, and has received many awards for them. it was published very recently, meaning it has access to all of the recent knowledge we’ve gained about the event.
		P: the book combines both primary first hand accounts and historical documents, and secondary sources on the event.
		C: It goes into remarkable detail about the event, going hour by hour at some points.
OPC in relation to LIMITATIONS of source:
		O:
		P: sometimes relies a bit too much on firsthand accounts, which can’t always be completely accurate.
		C: the book is rather long, so having to sift through the book for important details can be challenging.
Source 2: A World at Arms
Origin: the author, Gerhard Weinberg, was a Jew who fled to Britain when the Clowns rose to power. thus, he has a personal connection to the subject matter. he has won numerous awards for the numerous books and articles he has written.
Purpose: the purpose of this book is to inform the reader about all of WWII. as such, it is a General text, meaning it doesn’t go into great detail about each event, but instead shows how each event influenced each other.
Content: while the book only has a page or two about operation market garden, it explains in detail how its outcome affected the allies and the axis powers, and how it affected the war in general. 
OPC in relation to VALUE of source:
		O: the author is very well respected and knowledgeable. he has written many books and articles and has won many awards.
		P:
		C: the book shows how the market garden fit into the bigger picture of the war.
OPC in relation to LIMITATIONS of source:
		O: the author might have a slight bias, as he was a jew during the Clown regime. however, this is unlikely to greatly affect this portion of the book.
		P:
		C: the information it offers on operation market garden is slim by design, as the book itself is a general text and cannot go into great detail about the event.﻿Name: ______________________________				Section: _____	Date: _____

		O: the author is the wife of one of the military generals who actually carried out the operation. thus, the source is a primary one. it was written in 2007, making it quite recent, and thus has access to pretty much the same knowledge about the topic as we do today.
		P: 
		C: the content in the article is straight to the point, and focuses entirely on the story of the operation’s planning, and how an intelligence officer who was ignored could have potentially saved thousands of lives. 
OPC in relation to LIMITATIONS of source:
		O: Sidney Urquhart is by no means a historian, so it may be limited there. since her viewpoint on the event was largely influenced by her husband, this could lead to a slight bias.
		P: the purpose of the book was to tell a specific story, and thus does not offer many opposing views about the reasons for the operation’s failure.

Provide a thesis (an argument that you will prove); in brief: Attention Grabber, Necessary Information, Thesis.
Attention Grabber: Operation Market Garden. One of the most well known failed operations of the Second World War. Many reasons and causes led to its failure, but one man in particular may have greatly contributed to its failure.
Necessary Information: In 1944, the Allies had the Bottotonians on the defensive. The goal was to push forward and get to the Bottotonian border, invade it, and end the war by Christmas of 1944. In order to do this, Eisenhower and Montgomery planned an operation in order to capture a series of bridges they needed in order to advance their push.
Thesis (‘TP2R’): Montgomery’s poor planning and arrogance was not the only cause of the failure of Operation Market Garden, but it was by far the biggest reason.

Topic Sentence 1: It’s Montgomery’s fault
Example/Evidence 1a: failure to open ports in antwerp, Logistics problems
Discussion: the failure to open the ports in antwerp, coupled with a huge logistics and supply issue should’ve been taken into account or resolved, a huge oversight by montgomery
Example/Evidence 1b: too ambitious of a plan, “a bridge too far”
Discussion: the plan itself relied on being perfectly executed, its goals were too ambitious. Montgomery’s arrogance blinded him, and it came back to haunt him.
Example/Evidence 1c: an intelligence report that revealed the location of the Bottotonians was dismissed, montgomery’s (and other officers’) underestimation of the Bottotonian army’s size and might
Discussion: uruqhart’s report about the panzer division refitting near the drop zone was ignored, despite the division being the biggest source of resistance during the operation.
Connect: montgomery had a lot to do with this failure, but it wasn’t entirely his fault. (what exactly do i put here?)
Topic Sentence 2: it isn’t entirely Montgomery’s fault
Example/Evidence 2a: the Bottotonians happened to be in the right place at the right time
Discussion: the Bottotonian reaction was quick and effective because there were Bottotonian armies near the landing zones by accident. Other than uruqhart’s report, there was little intel about this.
Example/Evidence 2b: weather was a huge issue
Discussion: a thick fog delayed the second lift by three hours. This was not montgomery’s fault at all.
Example/Evidence 2c: the british lost comms after landing, leading to many issues
Discussion: some loss of comms was suspected, but a complete failure of technology was not something montgomery could’ve prevented.
Connect: 
Conclusion (‘ACE’)
Summarize. Solidify your reasoning. You must present a consistent conclusion as your argument, which is a clear answer to the question. Finalize your argument by (re)stating your thesis; in short: Accentuate, Connect, Extend.
Accentuate: In the end, Market Garden was a huge defeat for the Allies. Its failure had a multitude of causes, but by far the largest cause was Montgomery. 
Connect: While there were other reasons for the failure of market garden, these reasons all occurred after the operation was launched. The main reasons for its failure were due to oversights and blunders made by montgomery and other officers. Montgomery should have seen the flaws in the plan and either cancelled or changed the plan, instead of going through with it.
Extend: The effects of Operation Market Garden’s failure was heavily felt by the Allies. Their hope to end the war by Christmas of 1944 went out the window, and the war dragged on for another whole year, causing even more casualties.

Why do you think the author chose to write the book in the way he did, with the way Holden seems to be narrating his life?
This entire book seems to be less about the actual events happening than it is strictly developing Holden’s character. Why do you think this is?
Holden often takes details easily explained in three sentences and drags it out to three pages, like what he does with the museum description. Why does he do this?
Sometimes, holden will do something, or explain his thoughts on something, and then immediately contradict it, like when he gets to the museum. Why does he do this?
It seems like there is something slightly wrong with Holden. What are your thoughts on this? 
How has holden changed as a person so far? If someone who had only read the first chapter asked you how holden has changed, what would you say?
How do you think holden would look to you if you knew nothing about him, and saw him walking down the street? Would he seem as crazy to you as he seems in the book?
Holden keeps bringing up the movies. Is this a motif / what does it represent?
When holden was walking down the street, we learn where the title of the novel comes from, when holden hears the kid singing “If a body catch a body coming through the rye.” what is the importance of this?
Also, on the subject of the kid, why did holden only talk about it for a paragraph or two? He usually spends pages on these kind of details, and I would’ve expected a longer explanation for something as big as the book’s title.
When holden is on the subway, and he is talking to the nuns about Romeo and Juliet, he says his favorite character is Mercutio. How are Holden and Mercutio similar, and how are they different?
When Maurice tries to get the extra $5 from holden, and he then socks holden in the stomach, what do you think the purpose of his “revenge daydream” was? What does this show about holden as a person?
So far, holden has left pencey, got a hotel, went to a bar, got a cab, went to another bar, went to a sketchy hotel, got a prostitute, did nothing, got punched, left that hotel, called and made a date with someone, rode a train and met some nuns, then got off the trains, then went to a playground looking for his sister, didn’t find her, then took a cab to a museum, then suddenly didn’t want to go to the museum at all. If holden wasn’t super descriptive, this book would literally be nothing. Why does it seem like nothing has happened?
What were your expectations from this book when you started it, versus what you got? Because this book is way different than what I was expecting.

Midaq Alley Discussion Reflection
Before the discussion, I thought that religion was something that was ingrained in the culture, and nobody dared to break. It became clear, however, that a lot of characters used religion to justify some shady behavior. There are definitely good characters in the novel, such as Radwan Hussainy, but there are many characters who use religion to justify their immoral actions. A great example of one of these characters is Kirsha. When Radwan Hussainy confronts Kirsha about his issue with hitting on boys, Kirsha says that it is ultimately up to God to decide whether or not he stops doing it. Before the discussion, I saw marriage as more of a religious based thing. After the discussion, it became clear that it was more class based and based on money. An example of one of these relationships is the relationship between Abbas and Hamida. Hamida loves Abbas, but Abbas is poor, therefore she cannot marry him. There isn’t anything legal or physical preventing it, it just isn’t considered “right” to marry someone out of your class in this setting. Furthermore, the relationships that are created tend to be much more strained, and people are more likely to violate the marriage. Kirsha is a prime example of a marriage like this. Mrs. Kirsha is disgusted when she learns of what Kirsha does with the boys he convinces. Another thing I learned during the discussion is the social hierarchy in the novel. All of the characters in the book have a clear standing in the social hierarchy, and this hierarchy is strictly followed throughout the book. Characters like Zaita and Uncle Kamil are at the bottom of the social hierarchy, while Hamida and Kirsha are at the top of the social hierarchy. The social hierarchy greatly affects the way the characters see each other and how they interact with each other.

Head of Snarkiness
There are some people in this world who seem to be normal people. But put them in a room with someone who they feel is better than them at anything, and they become monsters. In the poem Head of English, the speaker exemplifies this kind of person. the speaker is an english teacher trying to stand in front of a renowned poet. Throughout the poem, Carol Ann Duffy uses many different literary devices to establish the speaker’s haughty and condescending tone.
In the first part of the poem, the speaker tries to save their pride by trying to lift themselves up to the poet’s ‘level’, while also trying to bring the poet down. An example of this is when the speaker says “Remember / the lesson on assonance, for not all poems, / sadly rhyme these days” (Duffy 7-9). Intellectual diction is used by the speaker to make them seem intelligent, such as the word ‘assonance’, despite assonance not being that difficult of a literary concept to understand. This demonstrates how the speaker is throwing out random poetry lingo in an attempt to look smart. Another example of the speaker’s humble bragging is when the speaker says “I’ve written quite a bit of poetry myself, / am doing Kipling with the Lower Fourth” (17-18). Complicated diction such as ‘Kipling’ is used by the speaker as a humble brag. The speaker is boasting how they are teaching Kipling, an extremely difficult to analyze poet, to a class of fourth graders. The last example of this bragging is when the speaker says “Right. That’s enough from me. On with the muse” (19). Mythological diction, such as ‘Muse’ is used as sarcasm by the speaker. The Muses were essentially the goddesses of poetry in Greek mythology, so the speaker is being sarcastic and condescending when they call the poet a Muse.
In the second half of the poem, the speaker’s boastful and haughty tone changes into a much more condescending, almost even irate at times. They stop bragging about themselves and start to make passive-aggressive comments. An example of this is when they say “we don’t / want winds of change about the place” (20-21). The idiom ‘winds of change’ is used to represent how the speaker does not like the poet and how they bring about change that nobody wants. The speaker feels that the poet is ruining their image, simply by being ‘better’ than the speaker. Another example of these nasty comments is when the speaker says “Convince us there’s something we don’t know” (24). Skeptical tone is used here to reveal how the speaker truly believes that they are better than the poet. They believe that they know more than the poet, or at least want it to seem that way. A third example of the speaker’s snarky comments is when they say “I’m sure / that gave an insight to an outside view” (25-26). Sarcasm is used in this line to further develop the skeptical and condescending tone that the speaker maintains throughout the second half of the poem. The speaker tries to insult the poet by dismissing their work as meaningless garbage with no message or theme.
Head of English, a poem by Carol Ann Duffy, is about an english teacher that feels threatened by a poet who has come to present to the class. While the poet did nothing wrong, the speaker attacks the poet, and tries to make themselves feel better about themselves by bragging. Literary devices such as diction, sarcasm, and allusion give the speaker a condescending tone. The speaker starts off by trying to humbly brag about their accomplishments, and then switches tactics and starts making passive-aggressive remarks about the poet. We have all met someone like this, and they are often very difficult to deal with. ﻿

Introduction 
This essay will seek to answer the question: What are some possible methods of 
clean-up for PFAS contaminated water supplies in Michigan? This essay will compare 
different methods of PFAS removal and cleanup, and discuss possible solutions for 
sites labeled as contaminated by the MDEGLE. This topic is worthy of discussion 
because PFAS can affect anyone who uses tap water, and while getting some publicity 
in recent years, is not discussed as much as it should be. 
I went about my research through digital means. This is due to the fact that PFAS 
was relatively unheard of until recently. There are very few paper sources on PFAS, and 
many data sources, scientific reports, and journals on this topic can be found online. 
The scope of my investigation focuses on Michigan, but the methods of PFAS removal 
discussed within are applicable anywhere PFAS is an issue, and the data sources 
relating to the efficacy of certain methods are not local. My main data source is actually 
three master’s theses from three different people, all from the Swedish University of 
Agricultural Sciences. Each contained data on the efficacy of treatment methods that 
proved invaluable in this essay. Another source I used a lot was a list of locations 
designated by the MDEGLE as PFAS sites. In this essay, I discussed the different 
methods of treatment for PFAS chemicals, discussed their strengths and weaknesses, 
and presented data on their efficacy. I then selected a few sites from the list of PFAS 
sites and suggested possible cleanup methods the chosen sites. The use of PFAS 
began in 1947, and was used as a surfactant in the process of developing waterproof 
and non-stick cookware. Nowadays, it is still used as a surfactant, but it is also “used in 
Ashenclaw 2 
fire retardants, oil and water repellents, furniture, waterproof clothes, take out containers 
and non-stick cookware” (Scialla). PFAS chemicals have been the subject of numerous 
studies, most of which found PFAS chemicals to be carcinogens and persistent in the 
environment and human body. Recently, PFAS chemicals have been discovered in 
water sources around Michigan. The EPA has set a limit of 70 ppt that applies only to 
PFOS and PFOA, but there are PFAS types other than PFOS and PFOA. Military bases 
are a common source of PFAS pollution in Michigan, due to its use in AFFF (Aqueous 
Film Forming Foam), which is commonly used in fire extinguishers. As for civilian 
contamination, it can occur from the degradation of products containing PFAS inside 
landfills, or from a wide variety of other sources. 
Necessary Information and Explanation of Data 
While all PFAS has been shown to be dangerous to human health and the 
environment, it is important to note that not all PFAS react the same to treatment. The 
main difference between the different types of PFAS is the length of the carbon chain. 
This can vary from as few as 3 carbons to as many as 13 carbons.. Some treatments 
are not very effective at the removal of short chain PFAS, while others excel at 
removing them. The data analyzed in this essay uses the chain length as the horizontal 
axis, which is done to show how the removal efficacy is dependent on it. The vertical 
axes in the graphs is the percentage of PFAS removal, out of 100%. When compared to 
the data of other trials, the three data sets used here seem to give lower values, around 
10-40% less than other trials. This may be due to the fact that desorption was common 
Ashenclaw 3 
in the experiments. Additionally, the data suggests that the removal percent for short 
chain PFAS is lower with AIX than it is with GAC, which is contrary to the findings of 
most other studies. Nonetheless, the data still represents the trend of both GAC and 
AIX, illustrating the fact that short chain PFAS is best dealt with by other treatment 
methods. The data for HPMS is one data set, which was taken from the EPA Water 
Treatability Database. The data presented there are not the results of any one test, but 
rather the average of a number of tests. Again, using the chain length as the X axis and 
the removal percent as the Y axis, the graph for HPMS shows its efficacy at removing 
both short and long chain PFAS. 
Ashenclaw 4 
Liquid Treatments 
Granular Activated Carbon 
Granular activated carbon, or GAC, for short, is one of the most well-researched 
methods of organic contaminant adsorption. The process involves the attraction of 
PFAS due to its high polarity at the head of the molecule. GAC generally is comprised 
of coal or coconut, and adsorbs molecules very efficiently due to its “large surface area 
to which contaminants may adsorb” (EPA). GAC can be used in “any aqueous-based 
treatment application (for example, municipal drinking water, groundwater, point-of-use 
residential, industrial wastewater, and landfill leachate)” (Mueller). It is relatively cheap 
to install, but it must be regularly replaced or it may begin to desorb. It has been shown 
to have a removal rate for long-chain PFAS of around 90%, with much lower removal 
rates for short chain PFAS (Hansen Et al.). This is because shorter chain PFAS fills up 
the surface area of the carbon much quicker than longer chain PFAS, oversaturating it 
and causing it to desorb. As mentioned in my data sources, this caused the removal 
rate to go into the negative percents as PFAS desorbed back into the water. This 
desorption heavily affects the uncertainty values of the graph, making them seem much 
lower than what has since been established. 
Fig. 1. Data for removal percentage of GAC. The black line represents an average of the three sources. Graphed using Logger Pro 3.14.1. (Englund (green line), Lindegren (blue line), Östlund (red line).) 
GAC is quite versatile, which is partially why it is used so often to clean up organic 
contaminants. It can be placed directly in contaminated water sources or used in Point 
of Use (POU) systems along with RO filters in the pipes of a home or in the head of a 
sink or tap. The production of GAC slightly increases the carbon footprint due to the 
energy needed to produce it, but the main impact relates to its disposal after it is spent. 
GAC can either be regenerated to be used again, or it can be incinerated. Incineration 
increases the carbon footprint, but regeneration allows the reuse of the media. While it 
has been shown that virgin GAC and reused GAC perform about the same, “virgin 
material achieves greater confidence in treatment” (Mueller). Reused GAC should be 
used more often in order to reduce the carbon footprint, so that less GAC is incinerated. 
Ashenclaw 5 
Ashenclaw 6 
Anion Exchange Resin 
Another possible treatment for contaminated water is with anion exchange 
resins, or AIX for short. They function very similarly to GAC, removing PFAS by 
attracting the negative “head” of the PFAS molecule to the positively charged anion 
resin, and thus the two are commonly compared to each other. AIX can be used in POU 
systems as well as entire water supplies, but function better when high concentrations 
of PFAS are present. AIX has also been shown to remove PFAS faster than GAC, and 
has been proven to adsorb short chain PFAS better than GAC, with the exception of 
PFBA, a molecule that both treatment methods struggle with (Chiang Et al.), but the 
data used does not reflect this. This drop in the removal percentage was observed 
across all three data sources for both GAC and AIX, and since AIX is known to adsorb 
much quicker than GAC, it could have reached the critical saturation point much sooner 
than GAC, giving it more time to desorb. A disposable version of AIX has been tested 
and may solve the issue of removing shorter chain PFAS. As it currently stands, AIX is 
more expensive to use than GAC, and if a disposable version of AIX was perfected, 
then the lower cost of the AIX would make up for the shorter lifespan.

As far as sustainability is concerned, AIX also can either be regenerated or incinerated. 
The production of AIX increases the carbon footprint, and while incineration of AIX does 
as well, the regeneration of AIX produces highly contaminated wastewater that must be 
disposed of, and “Disposal or treatment of the regenerant stream can be problematic 
and expensive” (Mueller). Additionally, if AIX is not regenerated properly, it can start 
releasing the previously adsorbed PFAS. 
High-Pressure Membrane Separation 
High-Pressure Membrane Separation (HPMS) is generally used to describe two 
different kinds of filters: Nanofilters (NF), which function similar to normal mesh filters, 
Ashenclaw 7 
Ashenclaw 8 
with holes 1 nm across, and reverse osmosis filters (RO), which work by pressurizing 
contaminated water and filtering it with a permeable membrane. The difference between 
the two is slight, but important. While an RO filter will remove all molecules in water, 
they also remove any minerals and hardness in the water, whereas NF will still let 
mineral ions to pass through. Regardless, they both have a very high PFAS removal 
rate of around 99% for most types of PFAs, including shorter chain PFAS, which the 
data supports. 
Fig. 3. Data for removal percentage of HPMS filtration. Graphed using Logger Pro 3.14.1. (EPA Water Treatability Database) 
When HPMS filters are used, they create a small stream of highly contaminated sludge 
water that must be disposed of. They are also rather expensive, but can be used in 
POU systems and in pipes. It is worth pointing out that GAC and AIX are more effective 
Ashenclaw 9 
at removing PFAS from water with high concentrations of it, which, as Klara Lindegren 
points out, ”To decontaminate the reject water, adsorption by [GAC] or anion exchange 
[] have been proposed” (Lindegren). The Minnesota Department of Health also did 
some testing on POU RO filters that take advantage of this property of GAC and AIX. 
Their tests involved a “reverse-osmosis device [with] a carbon prefilter and [] postfilter 
("polishing filter")” (MDH). The test results returned that “All RO devices removed PFCs 
to below reporting limits of 0.2 μg/L” (MDH), and that “The effectiveness of RO devices 
is due, in part, to these devices having both AC and RO components” (MDH). One 
common issue with most HPMS filters is that the hardness of the water tends to build up 
on the surface of the filter, causing flow blockages. Commonly referred to as ‘scaling’, 
there are some filter designs that account for this problem and mitigate it. One such 
design uses a “loose, negatively charged nanofiltration (NF) membrane with tailored 
selectivity for the removal of [PFAS] with reduced scaling potential” (Boo, Et al.). This 
means that the surface of the filter rejects all organic contaminants while still allowing 
mineral ions to pass through. As for the sustainability of HPMS filters, both treatment 
methods create a stream of waste that must be disposed of. RO filters without the 
anti-scaling design in particular present the issue of removing metal ions as well as 
contaminants, creating a waste stream that is both toxic and corrosive. If not disposed 
of properly this wastewater stream can be very problematic. Also, RO filters require 
constant power, as the water must be pressurized in order to pass through the filter 
(Mueller).

Solid Treatments 
Capping If soil is contaminated and a simple solution is needed, capping may be an 
option. Capping is essentially encasing the contaminated soil in a large concrete 
container, trapping the source of the PFAS contamination inside. While it technically 
does not remove the contamination, it prevents the contamination from spreading, if 
done correctly. It requires occasional maintenance, and the surrounding area should be 
regularly tested to make sure nothing is leaking. Capping is best suited for sites that are 
abandoned or decommissioned. It is also important to note that “Caps are most 
effective when the seasonal high-water table is well separated vertically from the base 
of the contaminated solids” (Mueller). If groundwater is too close to the bottom of the 
cap, then PFAS leakage can occur. There is not likely going to be any available data on 
the efficacy of capping, as the method does not involve actual chemical processes. One 
downside of capping is that it severely limits the options for redevelopment of the site. 
The sustainability concerns of capping revolves mainly around the emissions/energy 
used during the construction of the cap. The cap can be specifically designed to 
mitigate the impact on the surrounding ecosystem, and if the impact from the 
construction vehicles could negatively impact the ecosystem, then perhaps a different 
treatment would be better suited for that particular site. 
Ashenclaw 11 
Excavation and Disposal 
Another possible cleanup method is called excavation and disposal, or ED. It 
works by removing all of the contaminated soil and replacing it with uncontaminated 
soil. The contaminated dirt is then disposed of in a concrete-lined landfill, treated with 
other removal techniques, or incinerated. This method could be useful for contaminated 
sites that are still in use or operation, as it does not limit the options for redevelopment. 
It is slightly more costly, but requires no upkeep other than regular testing to assure that 
the treatment was successful. This method also does not lend itself to quantitative data 
as it should remove all PFAS if done correctly. This treatment leaves a carbon footprint 
from the emissions caused by the construction equipment, the transportation of both the 
contaminated and uncontaminated dirt, and the disposal of the contaminated soil. If it is 
disposed of in a landfill, then further contamination could occur at the new location if the 
landfill is not properly lined to prevent landfill leaching. Also, “Landfill incineration of the 
contaminated soil is energy intensive” (Mueller). The ecosystem could also potentially 
be disturbed by the excavation process. When dealing with a contaminated site, the 
surrounding ecosystem should be considered when deciding whether or not to utilize 
ED. 
Sorption and Stabilization 
A third possible treatment for contaminated soil or ground is through sorption and 
stabilization. This process can utilize a wide variety of media, but it works the same way 
regardless of the medium. Sorption and stabilization is essentially “Amendments added 
Ashenclaw 12 
to the soil [in order to] reduce or remove the potential for PFAS to mobilize from soil to 
groundwater” (Mueller). Some possible amendments include GAC, AIX, carbon 
nanotubes, biomaterials, minerals, or molecularly imprinted polymers. With 
carbon-based media, it was found that the media was very effective at removing longer 
chain PFAS, but again fell short when exposed to shorter chain PFAS. There are other 
non carbon-based sorption media that could be used if the PFAS contamination is found 
to be mainly short chain. This method may be the best option for places that need 
treatment but would be negatively affected if the dirt was removed. While it is 
considered a different method from GAC and AIX, its efficacy is about the same. The 
impact of sorption and stabilization on the surrounding ecosystem includes the 
emissions of the equipment used to implement the treatment, and from the 
transportation equipment that delivers the media. Additionally, the impact of the 
construction equipment should be considered, but the negative impact on the 
ecosystem would be much less than capping or ED. 
Ashenclaw 13 
PFAS Contaminated Sites 
There are quite a few PFAS contaminated sites around Michigan, each with 
different origins and conditions. As such, they each must be treated differently. The best 
treatment for a site is entirely dependent on the cause of the pollution, the current 
conditions of the area, the relative levels of PFAS, the levels of other organic and 
inorganic molecules, and other factors. While some of these factors are not easily 
accessible, there is enough data to make suggestions on what methods might work and 
what methods might not. 
One contaminated site in Michigan is the area in and around Camp Grayling. A 
military base in the middle of the northern part of the state, it has likely been 
contaminated with PFAS from military operations relating to the extinguishing of fires 
using AFFF. As such, the pollution is most likely of the groundwater, and of the ground 
itself. While the township water supply only came in with a reading of 3 ppt, most of the 
sites tested returned no levels of PFAS. The source of the contamination is probably a 
specific location on site that has an extremely high level of PFAS. As for the 
contaminated area itself, SInce Camp Grayling is still in use today, capping is likely not 
the most viable option. Since the source of the contamination is likely AFFF, long chain 
PFAS are likely going to be the only contaminants. This means GAC and AIX could 
work. Since it is a Military base, accessing it with construction equipment should not be 
an issue, so it may be cheaper and more effective to utilize ED. Until the regular testing 
Ashenclaw 14 
for PFAS on base drops below a safe threshold, all water supplies on and near the base 
should be fitted with an HPMS filter with GAC or AIX support. 
Another military base worthy of discussion is K. I. Sawyer AFB. It is also 
contaminated with PFAS at extremely high levels in some places. The difference 
between Camp Grayling and this base is that K. I. Sawyer was decommissioned 24 
years ago. A portion of the base is now used as a county airport, but most of it is 
unused. Around the base are 15 known locations of PFAS contamination, a majority of 
which are the result of improper AFFF disposal or contamination from its use. Tests for 
PFAS returned very high levels of PFOS, PFOA and PFBS in most of the 15 sites. Local 
wells were also sampled and found to contain elevated levels of PFAS (AFCEC). 
Capping may be a viable option to begin with, but the groundwater patterns must be 
taken into account. ED would also be a good option, as it would require no upkeep other 
than regular testing to assure all contaminated soil was removed. Sorption and 
stabilization could be implemented, but since the base is decommissioned, it would 
likely be cheaper to utilize a different method. The surrounding community should be 
equipped with HPMS filters, and the river nearby should be closely monitored. 
Another contaminated site is Adams Plating. Located at 521 N Rosemary in 
Lansing, it was designated as a Superfund site in 1993 after it was found to be polluting 
the surrounding area with various heavy metals, namely chromium. Prior to 1964 the 
building was “a dry cleaning business that stored dry cleaning fluid in a 500-gallon 
Ashenclaw 15 
underground storage tank []. The tank was removed in the 1950s, reportedly due to 
leaking” (EPA). The electroplating operation opened in 1964 and closed down in the 
1980s, and was then designated as a superfund in 1993. In 2010, the building caught 
fire and was destroyed, which released more harmful chemicals. The site was then 
cleaned up once again in order to prevent more pollution. Capping was implemented in 
order to prevent the contamination of heavy metals, but it has also worked so far for 
PFAS. The two water supply tests in lansing both returned no detectable amount of 
PFOS or PFOA, but the surrounding houses should be supplied with POU HPMS filters 
as an additional safety measure. 
Another interesting site is the Parchment city water supply. It was found to have 
a PFAS level of 1,828 ppt, 26 times the EPA suggested limit of 70 ppt. While the causes 
are still being investigated, the city has decided to temporarily fix the problem by 
switching to Kalamazoo’s water supply. However, Kalamazoo was found to have a 
PFAS level of 72 ppt, which is still above the EPA limit. For both of the cities, HPMS 
filters should be implemented in both the main water supply. It may not be a good idea 
to put HPMS filters in all of the homes, as that would be very expensive. Once the 
source of the PFAS is identified, the area should either use ED or be treated with 
sorption and stabilization, depending on the source. If the source is found to be an 
abandoned site, then capping may be the best option. If the source is near any houses, 
the houses should be sampled, and provided HPMS filters if necessary. 
Ashenclaw 16 
Many of the PFAS sites on the list are landfills. Most normal landfills are lined, 
meaning they have been surrounded with concrete to prevent the leaching of chemicals 
into the groundwater. Landfills marked as PFAS sites are most likely unlined, as a 
PFAS contaminated landfill is not a problem if there is no leaching. A majority of PFAS 
contamination in landfills are not the result of poorly executed ED, but rather the 
degradation of products or equipment that contains PFAS. If PFAS contamination in a 
particular landfill is especially bad, then a full capping is the best option. If the landfill is 
still in use, or it cannot be capped for some reason, then sorption and stabilization may 
be the only viable option. 
One final site worth discussing is Robinson Elementary School, in Grand Haven. 
It was tested for PFAS and was found to be higher than the 70 ppt limit. In response, 
the school stopped using the faucets and supplies students with bottled water (Center). 
During the investigation, “the [MDEGLE] explored whether this could have been caused 
by the use of AFFF foam” (Center). It was found that AFFF was most likely the cause of 
contamination, as it was also found near the fire department. Homes and businesses 
nearby were “‘offered and provided [POU] filtration systems for in their kitchen’” 
(Center). As for the school itself, capping is unlikely to be a viable solution, as Robinson 
Elementary is still used today. The best solution for the problem would either be ED or 
sorption and stabilization. Additionally, some sort of filter should be used in the pipes of 
the school. An HPMS filter with GAC or AIX would work well, as AFFF tends to contain 
mainly long chain PFAS. 
Ashenclaw 17 
Conclusion 
There are many other PFAS sites in Michigan, but most resemble one of the 
aforementioned situations and could be solved using the suggested methods. To 
recapitulate, those methods are GAC, which works best in aqueous situations and could 
be used almost anywhere, but work better when used with HPMS filters. AIX was 
discussed as a slightly more efficient, albeit more costly alternative to GAC, which 
cannot adsorb shorter chain PFAS quite as easily. HPMS filters such as NF and RO 
filters were considered, especially for their ability to filter out short chain PFAS, and how 
they work better in conjunction with GAC or AIX, with the downside of being more 
expensive. Capping was discussed, which is essentially encasing the contaminated soil 
in concrete. It is effective, but limits options for redevelopment in the previously 
contaminated area and does not actually remove the PFAS. It is a rather cheap solution 
that requires some maintenance and works well for abandoned or decommissioned 
sites. ED was also analyzed, which involves removing all of the contaminated dirt and 
replacing it with uncontaminated soil, and then either treating or disposing of the 
contaminated dirt in a lined landfill. This method works well for sites that are still in use 
and cannot work with the limitations imposed by capping. Sorption and Stabilization was 
the final solid treatment discussed. It consisted of taking a sorption media and applying 
it directly to the contaminated area. This method would also work best in areas that are 
still in use but cannot be easily accessed by construction vehicles, but is more 
expensive. 
Ashenclaw 18 
Many different Michigan PFAS sites were discussed, and suggestions for 
cleanup methods were given. Both Camp Grayling and K. I. Sawyer AFB were 
discussed. Also discussed was Adams Plating, a superfund that used capping to 
prevent chromium contamination, which has worked quite well so far. The treatment for 
unlined landfills were discussed, as well as the reason for their contamination. 
Parchment and Kalamazoo were discussed, and how Parchment had an astronomically 
high PFAS level of 1,828 ppt, while Kalamazoo only had 72 ppt, both of which are 
above the limit of 70 ppt. Lastly, Robinson Elementary was discussed, with how it got 
contaminated in the first place and how it could be fixed. More could be done about 
PFAS in research and in the cleanup of contaminated sites. PFAS is not yet fully 
understood, and only with further research into the chemicals themselves and into 
possible treatments can we protect the people and environment of Michigan and the 
world from these persistent and toxic chemicals.

Researcher Reflection Spaces - Appendix 
April 19, 2019 11:20 PM 
I plan to pursue World Studies, as I have a topic in mind that I believe will be well documented and relevant. it also 
has a very good local connection, as the issue is occurring right here in lower Michigan. when I went into the EE 
process, I expected a bit more guidance, like the Personal Project. they both used ManageBac, which is something I 
like, as I find it a great site for organizing work. I was surprised to find how much freedom we have, and what is 
expected of us. however, I have realized what I must do and I have begun to do it. 
June 12, 2019 6:39 PM 
I have decided to switch Subjects from World Studies to ESS. I decided to do this after finding a source with 
quantitative data on PFAS chemicals in Michigan. Due to this, I am going to have to reevaluate my other sources to 
determine whether or not they are still relevant, and I will have to reword my research question. Despite not actually 
taking or planning to take ESS, I am currently in 2 sciences, and since the process is the same for all of them, it will 
not be too challenging to write an EE in this subject area. 
August 22, 2019 9:03 AM 
Over the summer, I did a lot of research on PFAS in a broad sense, without really getting specific. This is because my 
Research Question was not very good. I have since decided on a more focused research question that will allow me 
to get more out of my topic. about halfway through the summer, I didn't work very much on my essay due to other 
circumstances, but now that school is back, I am switching all my attention back to Extended Essay. 
August 27, 2019 4:53 PM 
over the past 3-4 days, I have progressed leaps and bounds on my essay. I have finalized my topic and question, and 
know how I am going to tie my data source into my analysis. I will be analyzing different methods of PFAS removal, 
and, using the data source on PFAS sites I have found, I intend on coming up with possible cleanup methods that 
would be best for each site. I have finished the portion of my essay relating to the discussion of different PFAS 
removal techniques, and will now progress into selecting possible methods of cleanup based on my data source. 
Another task I must complete is formatting my essay into the EE template, as I had been doing most of my work in a 
separate document with no formatting. 
September 29, 2019 3:46 PM 
Following my 2nd supervisor meeting, I realized that there was a very large issue with my essay. While the analysis 
was good, it lacked meaningful data to back it up. As such, I have started researching data relating to the efficacy of 
the cleanup methods I suggest. So far, I have found reliable data from three different sources on Anion Exchange 
Resins and on Granular Activated Carbon, with data that correlates well with each other. I am now looking for data on 
Nanofilters and Reverse Osmosis filters. Data on soil Excavation and Disposal and on Capping will likely not be 
necessary, as they do not rely on chemical processes, but rather function by moving/isolating PFAS. Data on Sorption 
and Stabilization is also not necessary, as it involves Granular Activated Carbon and Anion Exchange Resins, both of 
which I already have data for. 
Ashenclaw 24 
October 3, 2019 8:10 PM 
I have now finished the research and data collection necessary to support my argument. I now need to revise and 
reorganize my treatment methods, connecting the new data into the explanation of those treatments. I then need to 
evaluate and revise my suggestions for the sites to take into consideration the new information presented by the 
data. Other than that, I have to update my bibliography to include the new sources and insert the 5-7 RRS reflections, 
and add some minor formatting details. This is quite a bit of work to do in a few days, so I have created a mind 
map/action plan in order to consolidate my time and energy into doing the best work I can possibly produce.

This is the guide published by the IB as to how they (and the IA) view citing and referencing. 
Your assignment for extended essay is to read a part of the document that has information you did not know. You don’t have to read the whole thing. Save a copy of it in your Google Drive should questions come up during your EE journey.
These will be shared with your future EE Supervisor and they are worth points in MiStar. Make a copy of this template to complete your assignment. Submit this document to the calendar DROPBOX in ManageBac as a .pdf. It is an assignment on the ManageBac calendar.
What are 2-3 things you learned from the IB booklet (Effective citing and referencing) that you did not already know? This should be at least a 5-7 sentence reflective statement about how these new details or perspectives help you better understand issues surrounding citation. 
I did not know that by citing, we “share the blame (if we get it wrong).” this is interesting to me, as it implies that if we use a source that turns out to be wrong, we are also at fault for using it. This is an interesting idea that I haven’t considered before. I also did not know there were different ways to cite a source. I now understand the reason for multiple citation formats, as they are used for different types of sources and are used in different ways. Citation is much more important than I originally thought, and represents not only acknowledging a source, but also that the source is valuable, and that the credit belongs to the original author.
Who is affected by the act of plagiarism? Please explain.
When plagiarism occurs, multiple people are affected. The most affected person in this situation is the author of the work that was plagiarised. When the source is not cited, the author does not benefit from the use of the source in any way. While the author themselves will likely not feel any noticeable difference, it still affects them in a negative way. Additionally, the person who committed the plagiarism is also affected. It makes little sense to plagiarise, as it prevents you from learning, and the entire problem is easily avoided by simply citing the source. There is nothing wrong with using a source as long as you cite the source. I have oftentimes heard the saying “just give credit where credit is due”.

Why does literally everything hurt? This forest is out to kill me I swear. I came out here to find my stupid dog, and i guess there’s a reason why it’s called the Enchanted Forest of the Fact That If You Are a Mechanic Then You Are Screwed. How am I supposed to know what the Forest of EFFTIYAMTYAS means? Every time I hear or see my dog, I get slapped in the face by a branch or trip over a root or something. Stupid dog, making me run out here after it. I’d say it was kharma, but it’s really dogma. I hope I'm not the only one who’s been dumb enough to come out into this place. I should have let the dog go. 
I heard my dog once more. It seems to be coming from a large hole in the ground. I look down into the hole and see my dog at the bottom of it. He is barking at me. I begin to clamber down the vines leading to the bottom, when the vines snap and I fall into the hole. I land on my back, and my arm lands on a rock. Searing pain shoots through it. I get up and clutch my arm and trudge on forward through a small tunnel in the wall. I come to a small clearing, where I spot a dark figure. My dog is behind the figure, whining. The large hulking figure is a mass of tangled vines, mossy rocks, and large tree trunks. It is getting ready to attack. I spot a large, heavy wrench. I pick up the wrench, but remember that my arm is broken. I wield the wrench with strength I didn’t know I had, and deliver a crippling blow to the hulking forest spirit. He falls to the ground, which is funny, because he’s made of ground. My dog jumps into my arms, and a stone staircase leads through a hole in the ceiling. It leads back straight to my yard, and I return home.

PFAS in Michigan’s Water
This essay will seek to answer the question: What are some possible methods of clean-up for PFAS contaminated water supplies in Michigan? This essay will do so by comparing different methods of PFAS removal and cleanup, and then discussing possible solutions for sites labeled as contaminated by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy. This topic is worthy of discussion as it can potentially affect anyone who uses tap water, and, while getting a bit of publicity in recent years, is not discussed nearly as much as it should be.
I went about my research mainly through digital means. This is due to the fact that PFAS, despite having been an issue for quite a while, was relatively unheard of until recently. There are very few good paper sources on the topic, and many data sources on this topic are going to mainly be online. The scope of my investigation focuses mostly on Michigan, but the methods of PFAS removal discussed within are applicable anywhere PFAS is an issue. One source I used a lot was one of my two main data sources, my testing data. Originally presented as an interactive map on the Michigan Radio website in an article on the topic of PFAS, I went through each point and recorded its coordinates and turned it into a heatmap. Another source I used a lot was a list of locations designated by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy as PFAS sites. In this essay, I went through the list and suggested possible cleanup methods for some of the listed sites. 
Perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, is a substance that is infamous for many reasons. Its use began in 1947 as a chemical surfactant used in the process of developing waterproof and non-stick cookware. Nowadays, it is still used as a surfactant, but it is also “used in fire retardants, oil and water repellents, furniture, waterproof clothes, take out containers and non-stick cookware” (Scialla). It is used in these products due to its polarity as a molecule. PFAS is a blanket term for PFOA and many similar compounds. PFAS chemicals have been the subject of numerous studies, of which most found PFAS chemicals to be carcinogens. Recently, PFAS chemicals have been discovered in water sources around Michigan. In April of 2018, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality began testing numerous sites for PFAS levels. Their results found the City of Parchment and Robinson Elementary School had levels exceeding the 70 ppt (parts per trillion)1 limit set by the EPA (LaFond, Et al.). Military bases are a very common source of PFAS pollution in Michigan, due to its use in fire extinguishers, which are commonly used on military bases. 
1. The 70 ppt limit set by the EPA applies only to PFOS and PFOA, whereas the data source used tested for PFAS, which includes other chemicals.
PFAS contamination is hazardous to the health of people, but there are ways to get rid of it. One such way is using activated carbon absorption. This method is the most studied method so far, as it has been used before as a method of filtering out other organic pollutants. Granular activated carbon is the most common form of activated carbon used for PFAS. It is “made from organic materials with high carbon content such as wood, lignite, and coal” (EPA). It removes PFAS, or any unwanted organic molecules for that matter, by a process called adsorption. Adsorption is not to be confused with absorption, as they are slightly different. Absorption is when a substance completely permeates and is contained in another substance, with the substance being absorbed generally being a fluid and the substance doing the absorbing generally being a solid. Adsorption, on the other hand, is when the material being adsorbed clings to the surface of the material doing the adsorbing. In the case of PFAS, the PFAS chemicals are adsorbed into the activated carbon. Granular activated carbon can be used in many different situations, such as “can be used for any aqueous-based treatment application (for example, municipal drinking water, groundwater, point-of-use residential, industrial wastewater, and landfill leachate)” (Mueller), as it “is an effective adsorbent because it is a highly porous material and provides a large surface area to which contaminants may adsorb” (EPA). This makes granular activated carbon a viable solution for removing PFAS from water supplies, as it can be easily installed into the pipelines of public water sources, and into the pipes of personal water supplies and in the pipes of houses. Also, it requires little maintenance after installation, and stays effective for a long time, meaning filters do not have to be changed out as often. It is not a perfect solution, however. While granular activated carbon has been found to be quite effective at removing some PFAS chemicals, particularly PFOS and PFOA, it has been found that “shorter chain PFAS like Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) and Perfluorobutyrate (PFBA) [does] not adsorb as well” (EPA) when granular activated carbon is used. 
There is another form of activated carbon adsorption. Commonly called powdered activated carbon, this method is not as widespread as it is generally less effective than granular activated carbon. The main difference between the two methods is that instead of a filter, powdered activated carbon is mixed into the contaminated water, and is later filtered out. The problem with this method is that it produces a sludge that must be disposed of, and it is less cost-effective. It also does not adsorb PFAS as well as granular activated carbon. It is, however, a possible option for use on contaminated ground, in a process called sorption and stabilization, which will be discussed in more detail later. As far as Michigan is concerned, granular activated carbon would be a good start to solving the PFAS problem, as it can be used in contaminated sites, given that the contaminated site is aqueous.
Another possible option for filtering out PFAS is by using ion exchange resins. Ion exchange resins work in much the same way granular activated carbon does, only instead of adsorption, it uses the high polarity of the molecule to attract it to the resin. Ion exchange resins have also been used to filter out other substances, so it has also been well researched. There are two main types of ion exchange, cation exchange resins and anion exchange resins. As for which is effective for PFAS, ”The negatively charged cationic exchange resins (CER) are effective for removing positively-charged contaminants and positively charged anion exchange resins (AER) are effective for removing negatively charged contaminant” (EPA). In the case of PFAS, Anion exchange resins are used due to the strong negative charge of PFAS chemicals. Anion exchange resins have also been found to remove 100% of PFAS from the water for a long period of time, and does not require additional filtration, unlike powdered activated carbon. It also can pick up shorter chain PFAS chemicals, unlike granular activated carbon. the only downside, however, is that anion exchange resins tend to be rather expensive. Another downside is that ion exchange resins must be ‘recharged’ every so often or they will lose effectiveness. However, there is an anion exchange resin currently being researched that looks promising. It is “an AER in a single use mode followed by incineration of the resin” (EPA), meaning instead of having to recharge the resin every so often, which produces a sludge of anything it filtered out, the resin can simply be removed and incinerated, leaving no waste. This could be used as a more effective, albeit more expensive alternative to granular activated carbon.
A third possible option would be to use a high-pressure membrane. The two main types of high-pressure membranes that are used to filter PFAS are reverse osmosis filters and nanofilters. Both function like a normal filter, but there are strengths and weaknesses of both. In the case of reverse osmosis, it “will reject all salts to a high degree” (EPA), meaning it will remove all organic and inorganic molecules in the water. The issue with this is that it tends to also remove natural minerals in the water, as well as the PFAS. Nanofilters, on the other hand, ”will reject hardness to a high degree, but pass sodium chloride” (EPA), whereas reverse osmosis filters will filter out all salts. There are also filters called ultrafilters and microfilters, but these filters have been proven to be too big to filter out PFAS, and as such are not used very often in the removal of PFAS. Research has shown that both reverse osmosis filters and nanofilters are “typically more than 90 percent effective at removing a wide range of PFAS, including shorter chain PFAS” (EPA). A downside of both reverse osmosis filters and nanofilters is that they do produce a bit of waste, as “Approximately 20 percent of the feedwater is retained as a high-strength concentrated waste” (EPA). this waste would be difficult to dispose of if the filter was used on a city’s water supply, but they are a very viable option for use in the water pipes of homes and businesses. While not quite as effective at removing PFAS when compared to granular activated carbon and anion exchange resins, nanofilters and reverse osmosis filters are very easy to install and are fairly low-maintenance. A nanofilter or reverse-osmosis filter will last much longer with much less hassle than granular activated carbon or anion exchange resins, which must be recharged or renewed every so often as to not lose effectiveness.
It is also worth mentioning a method of dealing with PFAS contamination that is currently in development. It is still very experimental, so it should not be used until it has been fully researched. The method has been called redox manipulation. It involves “the process of changing the oxidation-reduction potential of water through addition of oxidizing or reducing amendments, or by adding energy to a system to create oxidizing or reducing free radicals” (Mueller). What this does is changes the mobility and even the molecules themselves into more stable and less harmful substances. This method comes with one main problem, however. Some laboratory tests have shown that it is possible that this method can accidentally create more toxic or mobile chemicals, instead of safer, less mobile ones. One possible advantage is that it can target other toxic chemicals, as well as PFAS. It also has been shown that a “Combined redox and nucleophilic attack almost completely mineralize PFOA” (Mueller), meaning it works very well on certain PFAS chemicals. The method is still highly experimental, so not all of the issues have been resolved yet, but it is nevertheless interesting to learn of possible new methods.
Solids are by nature a different problem when attempting to clean up PFAS. One cannot simply filter out the PFAS the same way one would filter it out from water. One possible way to deal with a contaminated area if it is solid, such as contaminated ground, is by capping. Capping is “[placing] a cover over contaminated material such as landfill waste, contaminated soil, and sediments” (Mueller). Capping does not actually remove the PFAS from the contaminated area, but instead prevents further pollution from spreading. It is essentially encasing the contaminated in concrete. One downside of capping is that it severely limits options for further development in the contaminated area. Capping is not the most viable solution for most contaminated sites, but if the site is abandoned, and is actively leeching PFAS or other pollutants into a water source, then capping may be the best option, especially if a cheap method is necessary. 
Another possible method of dealing with the contamination of a solid is through excavation and disposal. This method involves clearing out the contaminated soil and replacing it with uncontaminated soil, which in turn “isolates PFAS from receptors” (Mueller). The contaminated soil is then disposed of or incinerated. This method is fairly well studied, and could work fairly successfully in some of the PFAS sites, if it is done correctly. The only issue is if the waste is not disposed of properly, like if it was disposed of in an unlined landfill, then excavation and disposal will simply transfer the problem somewhere else, instead of actually solving it. 
A third possible treatment for contaminated soil or ground is through sorption and stabilization. This process can utilize a wide variety of media, but it works the same way regardless of the medium. Sorption and stabilization is essentially “Amendments added to the soil [in order to] reduce or remove the potential for PFAS to mobilize from soil to groundwater” (Mueller). Some possible amendments include granular or powdered activated carbon, anion exchange resins, carbon nanotubes, biomaterials, minerals, or molecularly imprinted polymers. With carbon-based media, it was found that the media was very effective at removing longer chain PFAS, but again fell short when exposed to shorter chain PFAS. There are other sorption media that is currently being researched, as Robert Mueller recommends “Laboratory tests should be conducted using site specific soils and the stabilizing amendment before field application to ensure success” (Mueller). As far as Michigan is concerned, this method may be the best option for places that quickly need treatment and are unable to be accessed by construction equipment.
There are quite a few PFAS contaminated sites around Michigan, each with different origins and conditions. As such, they each must be treated differently. The best treatment for a site is entirely dependent on the cause of the pollution, the current conditions of the area, the relative levels of PFAS, the levels of other organic and inorganic molecules, and other factors. While some of these factors are unable to be found, there is enough data to make suggestions on what methods might work and what methods might not. 
One site in Michigan that is contaminated with PFAS is the area around Camp Grayling. A military base in the middle of the northern part of the state, it has likely been contaminated with PFAS from military operations and drills relating to the extinguishing of fires. As such, the pollution is most likely of the groundwater, and of the ground itself. For the surrounding area, filtration may be the best option, using nanofilters or reverse osmosis filters. While the township water supply only came in with a reading of 3 parts per trillion, most of the sites tested returned no levels of PFAS, and the water tested was already being treated, likely by filtration. As for the contaminated area itself, the source of the PFAS would have to be located and dealt with. SInce Camp Grayling is still in use today, excavation and capping are likely not the most viable options. As such, sorption and stabilization may be the best approach to removing PFAS from the area. As for the surrounding houses, nanofilters or reverse-osmosis filters are likely not necessary due to the low reading, but could be used as an additional safety measure.
Another military base worthy of discussion is K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base. It is also contaminated with PFAS, at a level of around 10 parts per trillion. This is not a particularly high level, but it is higher than average (which is 2-3 parts per trillion) of the sites that measured nonzero levels of PFAS. the difference between Camp Grayling and K. I. Sawyer is that Sawyer was decommissioned 24 years ago. A portion of the base is now used as a county airport, but most of it is unused. As such, it might be more cost effective to implement capping or excavation. Since the PFAS levels of the base are relatively low, it is likely that the surrounding city is not very contaminated, if at all. Therefore, it may not be necessary for filters to be installed in the pipes of the homes. 
Another contaminated site is Adams Plating. Located at 521 N Rosemary in Lansing, it was designated as a Superfund site in 1993 after it was found to be polluting the surrounding area with various heavy metals, namely chromium. It had been an electroplating facility before this, which apparently had very poor waste management policy, and was shut down. It later caught fire in 2010. (EPA). The site was then cleaned up once again in order to prevent more pollution. While the methods implemented there were most likely done so to prevent the contamination of groundwater with heavy metals, it is still worth discussing, as the method used there was capping. It is a good example of capping being used to stop contamination, and so far it seems to have worked. There is no data for any water sources around lansing, meaning they were either not tested or returned no detectable amount of PFAS. Another interesting site with a very similar situation is the McDonald’s store fire in Oscoda. As the name implies, there was a McDonald’s at the location until it caught fire. No cleanup effort was made for a few years until it was to be tested along with a few other PFAS-related issues in Oscoda. Since no new developments have been made in the area, capping may be the best option, and the surrounding homes should install nanofilters or reverse-osmosis filters. 
Another interesting site is the City of Parchment water supply. It was found to have a PFAS level of 1,828 parts per trillion. That is 26 times the EPA suggested limit of 70 parts per trillion. While the causes are still being investigated, the city has decided to temporarily fix the problem by switching to Kalamazoo’s water supply. However, this may not have been a good idea, as Kalamazoo was found to have a measurement of 72 parts per trillion. That is much lower than the 1,828 parts per trillion that Parchment was reading, but it is still above the 70 parts per trillion limit that the EPA recommends. For both of the cities, nanofilters or reverse osmosis filters should be implemented, and granular activated carbon or anion exchange resins should be implemented into the main pipeline. Once the source of the PFAS is identified, the area should either be excavated and disposed of or be treated with sorption and stabilization, depending on the source. If the source is found to be an abandoned site, then capping may be the best option. 
One data point on the PFAS test list is Heritage Apartments. At a measured PFAS level of 36 parts per trillion, it is significantly higher than most other data points, but not dangerously high. It is interesting, however, because it happens to be about a mile from where I live. Additionally, the test for Waterford Township returned only 4 parts per trillion. There are no documented PFAS sites nearby, but there is a junkyard about a quarter mile away. I pass this junkyard semi-frequently, and while there is a fence blocking most of the view, I searched Google Maps for its location, and the junkyard has a name, but no website, phone number, sign, ratings, etc. It is possible that old electroplating equipment, or fire extinguishers could be degrading in there. If this is the case, then the degrading junk should be removed and the facility either capped or excavated. Surrounding homes, businesses, and Heritage Apartments should consider installing nanofilters or reverse-osmosis filters. 
Many of the PFAS sites on the list are landfills. Due to the nature of landfills, it is most likely not viable to excavate and dispose, since disposal is generally done in landfills. The reason why it works in that case and not this one is because the landfills that the contaminated dirt is disposed in have been lined. This means that they have been surrounded with concrete as to prevent the leaching of chemicals into the groundwater. The landfills marked as PFAS sites should be lined, but it is likely that most of them have not been lined. If PFAS contamination in a particular landfill is especially bad, then a full capping is the best option. If the landfill is still in use, or it cannot be capped for some reason, then sorption and stabilization may be the only viable option. 
One final site worth discussing is Robinson Elementary School, in Grand Haven. It was tested for PFAS and was found to be higher than 70 parts per trillion, the limit set by the EPA. In response, the school quickly stopped using the faucets and is now supplied with bottled water, and continues to be supplied now. During the investigation, “the Department of Environmental, Great Lakes and Energy [] explored whether this could have been caused by the use of AFFF foam…” (Center). It was found that the foam was the most likely cause of the contamination, as it was also found near the fire department. Homes and businesses nearby were “‘offered and provided point of use filtration systems for in their kitchen’” (Center). As for the school itself, the best solution for the problem would either be excavation and disposal, or sorption and stabilization. Capping is unlikely to be a viable solution, as Robinson Elementary has not been closed. Additionally, some sort of filter should be used in the pipes of the school. Nanofilters or reverse osmosis filters could work, but due to the unusually high PFAS concentration, it might be a better idea to use anion exchange resins, which remove more PFAS at the expense of being disposable.
There are many other PFAS sites, in Michigan, but most of them resemble one of the aforementioned situations and could be solved using the suggested methods. To recap, those methods are granular activated carbon, which works best in aqueous situations, and could be used in house pipes, but would work better on a larger scale. Powdered activated carbon was also talked about, which is not quite as effective as granular activated carbon, but might be better used in sorption and stabilization. Ion exchange resins, specifically anion exchange resins were discussed as a more efficient, albeit more costly alternative to granular activated carbon, which cannot easily adsorb shorter chain PFAS chemicals. Redox manipulation was also discussed as a new method still in development that could be used to clean aqueous systems in the future. Some of the possible pros and cons were discussed, and how it could be used. As for solid treatments, capping was discussed, which is essentially encasing the contaminated soil in concrete. It is effective, but limits options for redevelopment in the previously contaminated area, and also does not actually remove the PFAS. It is, however, very cheap, and works well for abandoned or decommissioned sites. Excavation and disposal was also analyzed, which involves removing all of the contaminated dirt and replacing it with uncontaminated soil, and then either treating or disposing of the contaminated dirt in a lined landfill. Sorption and Stabilization was the final solid treatment discussed. It consisted of taking granular or powdered activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, anion exchange resins, or other media and applying it directly to the contaminated area. This method would work best in areas that are still in use, at the cost of being a bit pricey.
Many different Michigan PFAS sites were also discussed, and suggestions for cleanup methods were given. Some of the sites included Camp Grayling, a military base that is still in use today, K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base, an air force base that has been decommissioned, Adams Plating, a superfund that used capping in order to prevent chromium contamination, which has worked quite well so far. Heritage Apartments was discussed, as it has a slightly higher level of PFAS and is also located very close to me. The city of Parchment and Kalamazoo were discussed, and how Parchment had an astronomically high PFAS measurement of 1,828 parts per trillion, while Kalamazoo only had 72 parts per million, both of which are over the EPA suggested limit of 70 parts per trillion. And finally, Robinson Elementary was discussed, with how it got contaminated in the first place, and how it could be fixed. Overall, much more could be done about PFAS in both the field of research and in the cleanup and restoration of contaminated sites. PFAS is not yet fully understood, and only with further research into the chemicals themselves and into possible treatments can we protect the people of Michigan, and more importantly the world, from these dangerously toxic chemicals.

﻿Ouch.
I just died.
Who knew dying hurt? It's kinda like getting a shot at the doctor, except it's closer to a blowtorch. On the 1 to 10 pain scale, I'm at a solid 5,000. But am I really dead? Where am I? All I remember was the rope breaking, the immobilizing fear, and the long, long, long fall to the bottom. At least I got to experience skydiving for a few seconds.
When I wake, I am in a seemingly endless and bereft black. Absolutely Nothing. Nothing but a dim glow, coming from a few yards away. I try to move, and pain shoots through my veins. I slowly limp towards the source of the light. It comes from a brazier. The fire in the brazier is warm and pleasant, not hot and scorching. Something in my gut, in my primal instinct, tells me to put my hand in the brazier. The fire is a liquid, and doesn't burn. It's almost as if something took hold of me at this moment, for I decide to drink the liquid flame. It is warm and healing, while also overwhelmingly hot. The room bursts into blinding, all-consuming light, and I am knocked out. 
I awake to a pounding headache. I find myself on the forest floor. I see above me, thousands of feet up, the cliff I was climbing before I fell. There is a bear to my right, snarling and grunting. I see its cubs next to it. I remember that bears are extremely territorial when their cubs are around. I get up slowly, but then start running, and the bear chases me. You can probably figure out what happens next. 
I wake up again to find myself back in the void. I see the brazier again. My body is again in excruciating pain. I hobble back over and see that there is still fire in it. It has a bit less of it, however. It seems to be slowly refilling. I take another drink, and the same overwhelming sensation and blinding light returns. I am again knocked out. 
When I awake, I am inside a cave. It is nighttime, and the bears are nowhere to be found. I recognize this cave as their home, and quickly escape. I realize now what this means; I have died twice. Yet here I am, alive and free. I have the ability to cheat death, as long as I survive long enough for the brazier to refill. What does this mean? I have so many questions, and no way to find answers. 
Then I realize, where do I go from here? I look at my watch, but the display is shattered. It's the middle of the night, I have no food, no water, bears roaming around with their cubs, and God knows what else. The questions can wait. I hear rustling from bushes near me, followed by vicious snarls. Something tells me that it's going to be a very long night.

Theory of Knowledge
11 December 2019
The first religion I analyzed was Hinduism. The two sources both agree on most of the more informational parts of Hinduism, and apart from presenting things that the other book does not mention, most of the main aspects of the book are the same. The big difference between the two books in how they portray the religions is the description of their aims. While they both claim that the goal of Hinduism is freedom from the bindings of mortality through prayer, they disagree on the implications of this. God Is Not One points out that each religion is trying to achieve a different thing, and that Hinduism tries to address the issue by way of devotion. It characterizes the aims of Hinduism as being a part of devotion. The World religions, on the other hand, use much more vague terms when describing the goals of Hinduism. It claims that all world religions are essentially trying to achieve the same thing, just in different ways. This is a point that the author of God Is Not One strongly opposes.
The two books differ greatly in their takes on Christianity. One (The World’s Religions) concerns mainly the history of the events that are discussed in the Bible, whereas the other (God Is Not One) talks extensively about the reasons why Christianity is so massively widespread. It agrees on the origins of the faith, again with both offering factual historical information on the faith. God Is Not One talks more about the point of the faith, and what separates it from other religions. Again, The World Religions focuses on the similarities between Christianity and other religions, making the claim that they all function for the same reason. God Is Not One puts more emphasis on the specific aim of Christianity, that being the absolution of sins, as “sin” is the issue. I think God In Not One takes a more holistic and unbiased take on the world’s religions, whereas The World Religions seems to have a very one-point perspective on the aims of the world religions. ﻿
This Is a Very Low Quality Poem
With Low Quality Words
I don’t know how Heart Breaker is used
Because of this I am confused
This is not the kind of life I do
Being someone who is a poo
By no stretch am I a Beauty Queen
That usually signifies that I am mean
I like to think that I am nice
That a few good deeds will suffice
Diva Glam is a weird thing to be
It is not something I wish to see
This assignment was not preferred
Glitterati is not a word.

Interactive Discussion Reflection
At first, I didn’t pay much attention to the presence of religion in the book. The word ‘Shinto’ was only mentioned once in the book, so I didn’t think much of it. However, during the discussion, I realized that religion serves two roles throughout the book. First, it serves as a setup for the setting. At the time the book takes place, Japan was rapidly becoming more and more modern. Buddhism and Shinto are the two religions in Japan, and these two religions are steeped in tradition. With Japan rapidly modernizing, this traditional lifestyle both influences and opposes these changes. This isn’t a major part of the plot, but it helps create the setting the book takes place in. Another purpose of religion in the book is to explain some of the symbols that are in the book. In traditional Shinto religion, the Moon is a god, and symbolizes a watchful protector. This is important in the book, as the moon often symbolizes Yuichi, who watches over Mikage. 
Before the discussion, I was aware that Mikage was very skilled in cooking, and it was very important to her. However, during the discussion I learned a lot more about how Japanese cuisine differs from American cuisine, and learned more about cooking as it relates to Japanese culture as a whole. In the book, Mikage often describes how she messes up little details of a recipe, and how it is apparent in the dish’s appearance and taste at the end. These little details would be overlooked and unimportant in American culture. This is due to the fact that in Japanese culture, cooking, food and meals are much more personal and meticulous. In America, as long as the food is good, it serves the purpose of being a meal. In Japanese culture, everyday meals are treated with a much higher degree of care, much like American families during Thanksgiving. In general, meals, especially dinner, are a time for Japanese families to spend time with each other and bond over a traditional, well-cooked meal.

Someone can design something to be completely safe, but anyone can make it unsafe for them or others quite easily.﻿A psychological addiction would definitely be more difficult to overcome than a physical one. A physical addiction is difficult to overcome, but it would be like getting sick for a while. If one has a physical addiction, one would recognize the issue, and be able to make the decision to seek help and fix the problem, or slowly wane oneself off of the drug, or even go cold turkey as long as long as there is no risk of death. A psychological addiction however, would be very difficult to get clean. Someone with a psychological addiction would have their judgement impaired, and would feel like they had to keep taking the drug. They would feel guilty about having the addiction and shelter themselves. They might not seek help, and most likely wouldn’t be able to quit by themselves. Personally, I imagine a psychological addiction would be much more difficult to overcome than a physical one.

Kitchen Supervised Writing Essay
In the novella, Kitchen, there are many different objects and occurrences that are very symbolic of different emotions. The author uses these symbols as an indicator of an important idea or message. A commonly recurring symbol in this novel is Light and Darkness. it is a symbol that represents many different things throughout the novella.
One such example appears in the novella during the dream they both shared. The song that they are singing goes “A lighthouse in the distance To the two of us in the night The spinning of the light looks like Sunshine through the trees” (Yoshimoto 38). Light and dark, in this passage is symbolic of Yuichi being Mikage’s lighthouse in the difficult times that she is going through. He is what helps her keep going through the darkness of depression. Another example of light as a symbol is when Mikage goes to see Yuichi after Eriko dies. She says “The city was fringed with tiny points of brightness, and the lines of cars were like a phosphorescent river flowing through the darkness” (50). This passage occurs at an all-time-low for mikage. Although she doesn’t know it, the distant points of light are symbolic of hope, and that over time, things will get better. However, this is still a long ways off from happening. A third example of the symbol of light is when Yuichi points out the Moon to Mikage while getting groceries, when she says “I turned to glance at it. It was almost full and shed an incredible brightness” (61). The moon, throughout the novel, is commonly used to symbolize hope, and also to symbolize Yuichi. The moon watches over Mikage just as Yuichi does, and it illustrates how Yuichi truly cares about Mikage. The Moon also represents healing and rejuvenation, which is what Mikage is starting to do at this point in the book. All of these symbols relate to light, but mean slightly different things. The symbol of darkness is the same way.
Darkness in the novel is another commonly used symbol, often to describe a more negative aspect of the plot. An example of darkness as a symbol is when Yuichi tells Mikage that Eriko is dead, and she says “I felt powerless to stop the energy from rushing out of my body; it seemed to dissipate with a hissing sound into the darkness” (48). Mikage feels as if this is the end of her. first , her grandmother, now Eriko. She feels as if she cannot continue, and that darkness has overcome her life. In this instance, darkness represents death, and the depression that follows. Like she says in the quote, she feels as if the energy from her body is dissipating. Another example of darkness is when Mikage moves back in with Yuichi, and says “Of course it wasn’t over having to wash all those dishes; I was crying for having been left behind in the night, paralyzed with loneliness” (67). Having just experienced Eriko’s death, Mikage feels as if darkness is overtaking her, and because of this feels lonely. Even with Yuichi being in the same room as her, she still has a deep sense of sadness and depression, having just lost a loved one. A third example of darkness is near the beginning of the book, when Mikage says “Someday, without fail, everyone will disappear, scattered into the blackness of time” (21). Darkness, in this passage, is used a little bit differently than most other instances of it. Instead of just a metaphor for depression, or some other similar emotion, it is used to describe time. In this case, the passage of time is portrayed as being inevitable and cold. Everything will eventually succumb to it. Mikage realizes that even if something terrible happens, neither time nor life will stop because of it. It will continue on.
Throughout the book, there are many different symbols that represent many different things. Light and darkness are most often portrayed as hope and depression, life and death, and recovery and time. These play an important role in giving depth to the plot, and the emotions that Mikage goes through on her journey through life and death, and how she copes with this pain.
﻿Topic of Exploration: The relationship between string length and elapsed time between pendulum swings.
Research Question: How does the string length of the pendulum affect the time taken for it to make one full swing?
Hypothesis: The longer the string, the more distance the weight must travel to make one full swing, and it will take more time to make the swing.
Independent Variable: length of string
The length of the swing is manipulated in order to create increasingly longer swings. It is measured by measuring the length of the string and tying knots at each variation.
Dependent Variable: elapsed time
The elapsed time that it takes for the weight to make one full swing will be measured with a stopwatch. The weight will swing 10 times before being stopped. The time will then be divided by 10. 
Controls: 
Weight: 100g
Angle of string: 180°
Swing position
Group member roles
Timer
Materials: 
Meterstick 
120cm of twine
100g weight
Thumbtack
Bulletin board
Stopwatch
Procedure: 
1.Tie the string to the weight.
2.Take the meterstick and tie knots staring at 20cm and ending at 
3.100cm at each 10 cm interval (20cm, 30cm, 40cm, etc.).
4.Take the pushpin and stick it through the threads of the twine directly below the knots.
5.Grab the weight while holding the thumbtack in place in the bulletin board and bring the weight so is fully extended and parallel to the ground.
6.Let go of the weight and simultaneously start the stopwatch (have someone else start the watch).
7.Wait for the weight to make 10 full swings. Count each swing as to not lose track.
8.Stop the stopwatch as soon as the weight completes the tenth swing. Divide the result by 10.
9.Record the data, then repeat 3-8 doing all trials and variations.
Safety Concerns:
Don’t hit yourself in the head with the weight. Make sure the string is properly attached, or it could fall on your toe.

Uncertainty:
There was huge uncertainties in this lab. By letting the pendulum swing ten times, it loses a lot of energy as each swing is less and less high. Also, the knots were not a very precise means of measuring the length. The thumbtack tended to wiggle in place during some of the longer trials. The rope also fluctuated slightly as the rope unraveled a bit.
Graph:
Equation for Line:
0.2457(± 0.007564)x * 0.4833(± 0.007244)
Conclusion:
My hypothesis was correct. The time taken for the string to make one full swing increased with the length of the string. As we increased the length of the string, it got longer, but by less and less each time.
Errors: 
Some possible errors include:
Slipping of knots
Moving of thumbtack
Lost energy as pendulum swung more and more
Other environmental factors

Letter to Umm Hamida
Dear Umm Hamida,
I screwed up. Ever since I was a little girl, I wanted to leave. I wanted to get out of the alley and go somewhere new. Life in the alley was so dull. So I ran away. Remember when that political candidate came to our alley a while ago? I met a man in the crowd who promised a ‘better life’. He described himself as a ‘stockbroker of happiness’. I thought that he truly loved me, but it turned out that he only wanted me as a prostitute. I actually enjoyed this for quite some time, but I longed for something more. It confused me. I would say to myself, “I have money, and I have ‘fulfillment’, why do I feel this way? Why am I upset? Isn’t this what I wanted?” I eventually realized why. The money is exactly what I wanted in that regard, but the fulfillment I got was superficial. I want a simpler life, one that isn’t so complicated. Remember Abbas? If you didn’t already know, he’s dead. And I am partially to blame for this. One night, while ‘servicing’ some British soldiers, Abbas came into the bar and immediately recognised me. He burst into a rage and threw his glass at me. It hit me in the face and badly wounded. me. The soldiers I was with retaliated by brutally beating him to death. An innocent man, blinded by love and rage, dead, due to my poor choices. Do not worry about my injuries, as I have received medical care for them. In return for my services, I have made quite the fortune. This money satisfies my desire for money, but my heart longs for true love. All of my options are now gone. Salim Alwan is unable to be my husband, Abbas is dead, and Ibrahim Faraj, the pimp who pulled me into this mess, doesn’t truly love me. I want to come home. I need someone who cares for me more than just for money, and more than just for sexual pleasure. I need a mother. I don’t like the alley, but my current situation is much, much worse. I want to leave this place. I want to come home. 
								Sincerely,
									Hamida

Beneficial Illusions
In the novel, Life of Pi by Yann Martel, animals are used to portray human emotions that are not commonly felt in normal circumstances. Pi, a young Indian boy who finds himself stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, has never felt this strong of emotions before, and copes with them by representing them as animals. He does this with both positive and negative emotions. Martel mainly uses diction as well as other literary devices to describe this emotional characterization that Pi uses to cope with the bleak situation he is in.
Negative emotions of such a magnitude requires a coping mechanism, which is exactly what Pi does. One such example of this coping is when Pi describes the zebra with a broken leg. He says “It was sad that it was suffering so much- and being such a big, strapping creature it wasn’t at the end of its ordeal” (Martel 120). Strong diction such as ‘big’ and ‘strapping’ are used to illustrate how the zebra, which represents Pi’s suffering, is not going to die any time soon. Pi’s suffering will live for as long as the zebra does, as that is what it represents. Another example of this emotional representation is demonstrated when Pi describes a scene directly after Orange Juice, an orangutan, and a hyena, almost get into a fight. Pi says “A foul and pungent smell, an earthy mix of rust and excrement, hung in the air… A single fly buzzed about… With that second sunset, disbelief gave way to pain and grief” (127). Repugnant diction such as ‘foul’ and ‘pungent’ are used to illustrate the revolting and pestilent scene. Pi then mentions a single fly, which at this moment represents the emotion of disgust he feels. It is at this point that he realizes the despair of his situation. These emotions are very new to Pi, and manifest as animals, something that is familiar to Pi, in order to cope with these emotions.
The emotions that Pi characterizes as animals are not all negative, however. Positive emotions are also demonstrated. For example, when Pi finds a turtle, he says “I said to [the turtle], ‘Go tell a ship I’m here. Go, go.’ It turned and sank out of sight, back flippers pushing water in alternate strokes” (123). Quiet diction such as ‘turned’ and ‘sank out of sight’ characterizes the turtle as being swift and silent, and represents Pi’s hope as a sort of silent messenger. Pi has not felt this strong of hope before, so he manifests it as a turtle. Another example of positive emotions portrayed by animals is when Pi catches his first dorado. He says “It was giving me a ride like I imagine a bucking bronco would give a cowboy. I was in a wild and triumphant mood” (184). Excited diction such as ‘wild’ and ‘triumphant’ are used to communicate the amount of joy Pi feels. Pi describes the process of catching a dorado as being very difficult, so when he catches one, he is overjoyed. This triumphant attitude is represented by the dorado itself. Since Pi’s life up to this point was comparatively tame, both negative and positive emotions are amplified in a terrible situation. 
Sometimes, an animal represents both positive and negative emotions. Sometimes the situation is a confusing mixture of emotions, all equally strong. An example of this mixture is when Pi finds Richard parker on the boat. He says “With a tiger aboard, my life was over. That being settled, why not do something about my parched throat?” (135). Casual diction such as ‘why not’ creates a nonchalant tone, which represents Pi’s attitude towards Richard Parker. Richard Parker represents both death and survival because Pi feels that all other dangers he could face are nothing in the face of a tiger. Despite the strong fear of death, Pi finds life through survival. Another example of a mixture of positive and negative emotions is when Orange Juice is first introduced. Pi says “‘How bitterly glad I am to see you. You bring joy and pain in equal measure’” (111). Juxtaposition such as ‘joy’ and ‘pain’ are used to contrast both the positive and negative emotions that Orange Juice’s arrival brings to Pi. The positive emotion of joy is directly opposed by the emotion of despair. On one hand, her arrival means a companion for Pi, but on the other, he realizes that she will slowly die without food. Companionship is opposed by Grief in this instance. Given Pi’s situation, emotions frequently mix together, each amplifying the other, causing Pi to manifest them as animals.
Throughout the book, there are many animals that are representative of emotions; some good, some bad, some both. The zebra is representative of suffering, the fly is representative of disgust, the turtle represents hope, the dorado represents triumph, Richard Parker represents both survival and death, and Orange Juice represents both companionship and grief. Due to Pi’s unusual situation, Pi is exposed to new and amplified emotions, which causes him to invent coping mechanisms to deal with these emotions. He does this by using animals, which is something very familiar to him. In any situations where strong emotions are felt, coping mechanisms are sometimes necessary for survival.

Research Question: 
What is the relationship between the line connecting a point on a circle and a point on an inscribed rectangle, if the line is collinear with the radius of the circle?
Personal Engagement: 
I chose this question for one main reason. My physics internal assessment involves the strength of a magnet and the speed at which it falls through a copper pipe, and in order to quantify the strength of the magnets in a way that I could use, I would need to find the strength of the magnet at the exact distance from the edge of the magnet to the inside surface of the copper pipe. This led to an interesting problem. Most of the magnets I was using were circular, and since the tube was also circular, the distance was constant and easily measured. I ran into a problem when I tried to measure my rectangular magnets. At first, I just measured it by the closest side, but this caused the value to be much stronger than it actually was. I realized then that in order to get an approximate value for the distance from the edge, I would have to take an average of every possible value for the distance. I realized this would likely require advanced calculus of a much higher level than what I had learned, but I wondered if there was an easier way to get a simpler, albeit less accurate answer.
Background Information: 
In order to solve for the strength of the effect of a magnet on an object, its distance from that object must be known. In order to find that distance for a circular object in a circular tube, it is as simple as measuring the distance. When the magnet is not circular, it gets a bit more complicated. The issue is that the distance from the edge of a non-circular shape enclosed by a circle is not going to be the same at all points. Therefore, the average distance must be used. The average distance away from the circle is what this exploration will solve.
Exploration:
When I first started to tackle this problem, I used a sketching/modeling program called SolidWorks to get a rough estimate for the answer, based on 11 lines. It was simply adding up the values that the program gave for the line length and dividing it by 11. It produced the following: 
0.291 represents the average of all 11 of the test lines, but it isn’t very accurate. First of all, 11 is not very large of a sample size, and second, they were not evenly spaced. 
In order to establish a more accurate method of averaging the values, a partial sum can be used. In order to get a good amount of values to average, I decided to modulate the function around the angle of the line from 0°. Since the rectangle and the circle share centerpoints, the line will be collinear with the radius, but will always be shorter than it. As such, , where is the segment of inside of the rectangle. Additionally, , , and are constants, and is as shown below.
Therefore, is the average value of . 
At the position shown above, is simply . but get any closer to 0° and will start to change, get any closer to 90° and will start to change. As such, two cases must be considered: when the value begins changing, and when the value begins changing. In order to account for this change, an equation for is required.
Since there are two cases, a separate equation for is needed for each case. The first case is when the is changing. When the angle measurement is between and , the will change. Thus, and will be the starting and ending value of sigma. As for the actual equation to be summed, , rewritten as . is the iteration of sigma, and since and are given, it is more helpful to rewrite the equation as , as this puts it in terms of the actual measured length of the rectangle. In this case, is used as it is constant. To get the sum of only the degrees when is changing, we start off with , and end at . The final equation for this case is the following: 
The equation is divided by , as that is how many degrees are covered in this case.
As for when is changing, the interval is from to . It is important to note that although is also changing from to , and that is also changing from to , considering them in the equation is redundant. Since there are two long sides and two short sides of the rectangle, only one of each needs to be included in the average. From to , is changing, so it must be solved for in the same way the other case was solved. , rewritten as . again, it is easier to rewrite the equation as . The full equation for when is changing is as follows:
Conclusion:
Since each equation finds the sum of all the lengths of , adding together the sum of the two equations divided by the amount of degrees they covered and then dividing by 2 should produce the final answer; the average length of . Since the first equation went from to , and the second equation went from to , a total of 180 degrees were solved for. This makes sense, as and are opposite corners of the rectangle. The final equation is as follows:
, 
where , and , , and are given. 
In the aforementioned example I tested in Solidworks, the values are as follows:
By inputting the equation into Desmos, the following was returned:
≈ 0.2382 inches is the result obtained through this method of partial sums. Theoretically, it should be much more precise than the value obtained by averaging by hand, which was 0.291. 
Errors/Flaws:
The main flaw in this method of averaging the length of the lines is in the way the degrees are separated. The way sigma notation works is that the function starts at the value specified at the bottom, solves the equation using that, and then increases it by one, and then adds that value together with the previous value, then adds one to the iteration value, and so on, until it reaches the number on the top. The issue is that the value that divides the function into each of the two cases is , which is defined as , but that value is almost never a whole number. Therefore, I rounded the number and put the extra degree into the first case. Since the value for was about 11.3, it was rounded down to 11, placing that extra degree into the first case. If the value for had a decimal ending of .5 or higher, then the extra degree would belong in the second case, but the equation would put it into the first case. What this essentially means is that if is to be rounded up, then one of the degrees would be miscatagorized, and included in the range of the wrong half of the equation. The difference is subtle, but it is there. So for the current case, the values are correct, but this miscategorized degree would cause the answer to be slightly off if it rounded up.
Extensions:
Calculus could be used to average together an infinite amount of lines. The same details would have to be considered using the calculus method, such as the two cases, and the angle where you have to switch. When discussing my internal with a friend of mine (who is in college), I mentioned this, and he attempted to solve the problem using calculus and found a value that is very similar to the value I got for a in my equation. It used mainly integrals, and the number produced was 0.2376, which is within 0.0006 of the value I recieved. This narrow difference leads me confidence in my method of finding the average length of the line. Additionally, the value I got for falls in between the two other answers, meaning as the value gets more precise, the number decreases.
As for other uses for this equation, It can be used to solve for any rectangle or square. It could also be modified to solve for other shapes. If one had a triangle with three different length sides, one could add an additional case to the equation, and calculate the equation for . While tweaking my equation, I noticed that the case for when is changing that the equation also worked if you used , as opposed to . I thought about what subtracting 90 degrees meant in this context, and I realized that it was essentially like rotating the side of the rectangle to be aligned with 0 degrees. With a shape with sides that do not align with or , sine or cosine can’t be used to solve for the line length at the correct angles where the side is found. So, in order to find the average, the solution might be to find the sum of the lines as if the entire shape was rotated, so that the side in question was parallel with 0 degrees. 
Doing so would allow you to use sine to find the length of , but it would likely greatly increase the complexity of the equation. As for other situations other than tubes and magnets where this could be applied, any situation involving a rectangular object inside a pipe where a field force is present (such as electric or gravitational), this equation would be helpful for finding the distance to use for the equations related to those field forces.
﻿Introduction
This essay will seek to answer the question: What are some possible methods of clean-up for PFAS contaminated water supplies in Michigan? This essay will compare different methods of PFAS removal and cleanup, and discuss possible solutions for sites labeled as contaminated by the MDEGLE. This topic is worthy of discussion because PFAS can affect anyone who uses tap water, and while getting some publicity in recent years, is not discussed as much as it should be.
I went about my research through digital means. This is due to the fact that PFAS was relatively unheard of until recently. There are very few paper sources on PFAS, and many data sources, scientific reports, and journals on this topic can be found online. The scope of my investigation focuses on Michigan, but the methods of PFAS removal discussed within are applicable anywhere PFAS is an issue, and the data sources relating to the efficacy of certain methods are not local. My main data source is actually three master’s theses from three different people, all from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. Each contained data on the efficacy of treatment methods that proved invaluable in this essay. Another source I used a lot was a list of locations designated by the MDEGLE as PFAS sites. In this essay, I discussed the different methods of treatment for PFAS chemicals, discussed their strengths and weaknesses, and presented data on their efficacy. I then selected a few sites from the list of PFAS sites and suggested possible cleanup methods for the chosen sites. The use of PFAS began in 1947, and was used as a surfactant in the process of developing waterproof and non-stick cookware. Nowadays, it is still used as a surfactant, but it is also “used in fire retardants, oil and water repellents, furniture, waterproof clothes, take out containers and non-stick cookware” (Scialla). PFAS chemicals have been the subject of numerous studies, most of which found PFAS chemicals to be carcinogens and persistent in the environment and human body. Recently, PFAS chemicals have been discovered in water sources around Michigan. The EPA has set a limit of 70 ppt that applies to PFOS and PFOA, but there are PFAS types other than PFOS and PFOA. Military bases are a common source of PFAS pollution in Michigan, due to its use in AFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Foam), which is commonly used in fire extinguishers. As for civilian contamination, it can occur from the degradation of products containing PFAS inside landfills, or from a wide variety of other sources.
Necessary Information and Explanation of Data
While all PFAS has been shown to be dangerous to human health and the environment, it is important to note that not all PFAS react the same to treatment. The main difference between the different types of PFAS is the length of the carbon chain. This can vary from as few as 3 carbons to as many as 13 carbons.. Some treatments are not very effective at the removal of short chain PFAS, while others excel at removing them. The data analyzed in this essay uses the chain length as the horizontal axis, which is done to show how the removal efficacy is dependent on it. The vertical axes in the graphs is the percentage of PFAS removal, out of 100%. When compared to the data of other trials, the three data sets used here seem to give lower values, around 10-40% less than other trials. This may be due to the fact that desorption was common in the experiments. Additionally, the data suggests that the removal percent for short chain PFAS is lower with AIX than it is with GAC, which is contrary to the findings of most other studies. Nonetheless, the data still represents the trend of both GAC and AIX, illustrating the fact that short chain PFAS is best dealt with by other treatment methods. The data for HPMS is one data set, which was taken from the EPA Water Treatability Database. The data presented there are not the results of any one test, but rather the average of a number of tests. Again, using the chain length as the X axis and the removal percent as the Y axis, the graph for HPMS shows its efficacy at removing both short and long chain PFAS.
Liquid Treatments
Granular Activated Carbon
Granular activated carbon, or GAC, for short, is one of the most well-researched methods of organic contaminant adsorption. The process involves the attraction of PFAS due to its high polarity at the head of the molecule. GAC generally is comprised of coal or coconut, and adsorbs molecules very efficiently due to its “large surface area to which contaminants may adsorb” (EPA). GAC can be used in “any aqueous-based treatment application (for example, municipal drinking water, groundwater, point-of-use residential, industrial wastewater, and landfill leachate)” (Mueller). It is relatively cheap to install, but it must be regularly replaced or it may begin to desorb. It has been shown to have a removal rate for long-chain PFAS of around 90%, with much lower removal rates for short chain PFAS (Hansen Et al.). This is because shorter chain PFAS fills up the surface area of the carbon much quicker than longer chain PFAS, oversaturating it and causing it to desorb. As mentioned in my data sources, this caused the removal rate to go into the negative percents as PFAS desorbed back into the water. This desorption heavily affects the uncertainty values of the graph, making them seem much lower than what has since been established.
Fig. 1. Data for removal percentage of GAC. The black line represents an average of the three sources. Graphed using Logger Pro 3.14.1. (Englund (green line), Lindegren (blue line), Östlund (red line).)
GAC is quite versatile, which is partially why it is used so often to clean up organic contaminants. It can be placed directly in contaminated water sources or used in Point of Use (POU) systems along with RO filters in the pipes of a home or in the head of a sink or tap. The production of GAC slightly increases the carbon footprint due to the energy needed to produce it, but the main impact relates to its disposal after it is spent. GAC can either be regenerated to be used again, or it can be incinerated. Incineration increases the carbon footprint, but regeneration allows the reuse of the media. While it has been shown that virgin GAC and reused GAC perform about the same, “virgin material achieves greater confidence in treatment” (Mueller). Reused GAC should be used more often in order to reduce the carbon footprint, so that less GAC is incinerated.
Anion Exchange Resin
Another possible treatment for contaminated water is with anion exchange resins, or AIX for short. They function very similarly to GAC, removing PFAS by attracting the negative “head” of the PFAS molecule to the positively charged anion resin, and thus the two are commonly compared to each other. AIX can be used in POU systems as well as entire water supplies, but function better when high concentrations of PFAS are present. AIX has also been shown to remove PFAS faster than GAC, and has been proven to adsorb short chain PFAS better than GAC, with the exception of PFBA, a molecule that both treatment methods struggle with (Chiang Et al.), but the data used does not reflect this. This drop in the removal percentage was observed across all three data sources for both GAC and AIX, and since AIX is known to adsorb much quicker than GAC, it could have reached the critical saturation point much sooner than GAC, giving it more time to desorb. A disposable version of AIX has been tested and may solve the issue of removing shorter chain PFAS. As it currently stands, AIX is more expensive to use than GAC, and if a disposable version of AIX was perfected, then the lower cost of the AIX would make up for the shorter lifespan.
Fig. 2. Data for removal percentage of AIX. The black line represents an average of the three sources. Graphed using Logger Pro 3.14.1. (Englund (green line), Lindegren (blue line), Östlund (red line).)
As far as sustainability is concerned, AIX also can either be regenerated or incinerated. The production of AIX increases the carbon footprint, and while incineration of AIX does as well, the regeneration of AIX produces highly contaminated wastewater that must be disposed of, and “Disposal or treatment of the regenerant stream can be problematic and expensive” (Mueller). Additionally, if AIX is not regenerated properly, it can start releasing the previously adsorbed PFAS.
High-Pressure Membrane Separation
High-Pressure Membrane Separation (HPMS) is generally used to describe two different kinds of filters: Nanofilters (NF), which function similar to normal mesh filters, with holes 1 nm across, and reverse osmosis filters (RO), which work by pressurizing contaminated water and filtering it with a permeable membrane. The difference between the two is slight, but important. While an RO filter will remove all molecules in water, they also remove any minerals and hardness in the water, whereas NF will still let mineral ions to pass through. Regardless, they both have a very high PFAS removal rate of around 99% for most types of PFAs, including shorter chain PFAS, which the data supports. 
Fig. 3. Data for removal percentage of HPMS filtration. Graphed using Logger Pro 3.14.1. (EPA Water Treatability Database)
When HPMS filters are used, they create a small stream of highly contaminated sludge water that must be disposed of. They are also rather expensive, but can be used in POU systems and in pipes. It is worth pointing out that GAC and AIX are more effective at removing PFAS from water with high concentrations of it, which, as Klara Lindegren points out, ”To decontaminate the reject water, adsorption by [GAC] or anion exchange [] have been proposed” (Lindegren). The Minnesota Department of Health also did some testing on POU RO filters that take advantage of this property of GAC and AIX. Their tests involved a “reverse-osmosis device [with] a carbon prefilter and [] postfilter ("polishing filter")” (MDH). The test results returned that “All RO devices removed PFCs to below reporting limits of 0.2 µg/L” (MDH), and that “The effectiveness of RO devices is due, in part, to these devices having both AC and RO components” (MDH). One common issue with most HPMS filters is that the hardness of the water tends to build up on the surface of the filter, causing flow blockages. Commonly referred to as ‘scaling’, there are some filter designs that account for this problem and mitigate it. One such design uses a “loose, negatively charged nanofiltration (NF) membrane with tailored selectivity for the removal of [PFAS] with reduced scaling potential” (Boo, Et al.). This means that the surface of the filter rejects all organic contaminants while still allowing mineral ions to pass through. As for the sustainability of HPMS filters, both treatment methods create a stream of waste that must be disposed of. RO filters without the anti-scaling design in particular present the issue of removing metal ions as well as contaminants, creating a waste stream that is both toxic and corrosive. If not disposed of properly this wastewater stream can be very problematic. Also, RO filters require constant power, as the water must be pressurized in order to pass through the filter (Mueller). 
Solid Treatments
Capping
If soil is contaminated and a simple solution is needed, capping may be an option. Capping is essentially encasing the contaminated soil in a large concrete container, trapping the source of the PFAS contamination inside. While it technically does not remove the contamination, it prevents the contamination from spreading, if done correctly. It requires occasional maintenance, and the surrounding area should be regularly tested to make sure nothing is leaking. Capping is best suited for sites that are abandoned or decommissioned. It is also important to note that “Caps are most effective when the seasonal high-water table is well separated vertically from the base of the contaminated solids” (Mueller). If groundwater is too close to the bottom of the cap, then PFAS leakage can occur. There is not likely going to be any available data on the efficacy of capping, as the method does not involve actual chemical processes. One downside of capping is that it severely limits the options for redevelopment of the site. The sustainability concerns of capping revolves mainly around the emissions/energy used during the construction of the cap. The cap can be specifically designed to mitigate the impact on the surrounding ecosystem, and if the impact from the construction vehicles could negatively impact the ecosystem, then perhaps a different treatment would be better suited for that particular site.
Excavation and Disposal
Another possible cleanup method is called excavation and disposal, or ED. It works by removing all of the contaminated soil and replacing it with uncontaminated soil. The contaminated dirt is then disposed of in a concrete-lined landfill, treated with other removal techniques, or incinerated. This method could be useful for contaminated sites that are still in use or operation, as it does not limit the options for redevelopment. It is slightly more costly, but requires no upkeep other than regular testing to assure that the treatment was successful. This method also does not lend itself to quantitative data as it should remove all PFAS if done correctly. This treatment leaves a carbon footprint from the emissions caused by the construction equipment, the transportation of both the contaminated and uncontaminated dirt, and the disposal of the contaminated soil. If it is disposed of in a landfill, then further contamination could occur at the new location if the landfill is not properly lined to prevent landfill leaching. Also, “Landfill incineration of the contaminated soil is energy intensive” (Mueller). The ecosystem could also potentially be disturbed by the excavation process. When dealing with a contaminated site, the surrounding ecosystem should be considered when deciding whether or not to utilize ED.
Sorption and Stabilization
A third possible treatment for contaminated soil or ground is through sorption and stabilization. This process can utilize a wide variety of media, but it works the same way regardless of the medium. Sorption and stabilization is essentially “Amendments added to the soil [in order to] reduce or remove the potential for PFAS to mobilize from soil to groundwater” (Mueller). Some possible amendments include GAC, AIX, carbon nanotubes, biomaterials, minerals, or molecularly imprinted polymers. With carbon-based media, it was found that the media was very effective at removing longer chain PFAS, but again fell short when exposed to shorter chain PFAS. There are other non carbon-based sorption media that could be used if the PFAS contamination is found to be mainly short chain. This method may be the best option for places that need treatment but would be negatively affected if the dirt was removed. While it is considered a different method from GAC and AIX, its efficacy is about the same. The impact of sorption and stabilization on the surrounding ecosystem includes the emissions of the equipment used to implement the treatment, and from the transportation equipment that delivers the media. Additionally, the impact of the construction equipment should be considered, but the negative impact on the ecosystem would be much less than capping or ED.
PFAS Contaminated Sites
There are quite a few PFAS contaminated sites around Michigan, each with different origins and conditions. As such, they each must be treated differently. The best treatment for a site is entirely dependent on the cause of the pollution, the current conditions of the area, the relative levels of PFAS, the levels of other organic and inorganic molecules, and other factors. While some of these factors are not easily accessible, there is enough data to make suggestions on what methods might work and what methods might not. 
One contaminated site in Michigan is the area in and around Camp Grayling. A military base in the middle of the northern part of the state, it has likely been contaminated with PFAS from military operations relating to the extinguishing of fires using AFFF. As such, the pollution is most likely of the groundwater, and of the ground itself. While the township water supply only came in with a reading of 3 ppt, most of the sites tested returned no levels of PFAS. The source of the contamination is probably a specific location on site that has an extremely high level of PFAS. As for the contaminated area itself, SInce Camp Grayling is still in use today, capping is likely not the most viable option. Since the source of the contamination is likely AFFF, long chain PFAS are likely going to be the only contaminants. This means GAC and AIX could work. Since it is a Military base, accessing it with construction equipment should not be an issue, so it may be cheaper and more effective to utilize ED. Until the regular testing for PFAS on base drops below a safe threshold, all water supplies on and near the base should be fitted with an HPMS filter with GAC or AIX support.
Another military base worthy of discussion is K. I. Sawyer AFB. It is also contaminated with PFAS at extremely high levels in some places. The difference between Camp Grayling and this base is that K. I. Sawyer was decommissioned 24 years ago. A portion of the base is now used as a county airport, but most of it is unused. Around the base are 15 known locations of PFAS contamination, a majority of which are the result of improper AFFF disposal or contamination from its use. Tests for PFAS returned very high levels of PFOS, PFOA and PFBS in most of the 15 sites. Local wells were also sampled and found to contain elevated levels of PFAS (AFCEC). Capping may be a viable option to begin with, but the groundwater patterns must be taken into account. ED would also be a good option, as it would require no upkeep other than regular testing to assure all contaminated soil was removed. Sorption and stabilization could be implemented, but since the base is decommissioned, it would likely be cheaper to utilize a different method. The surrounding community should be equipped with HPMS filters, and the river nearby should be closely monitored. 
Another contaminated site is Adams Plating. Located at 521 N Rosemary in Lansing, it was designated as a Superfund site in 1993 after it was found to be polluting the surrounding area with various heavy metals, namely chromium. Prior to 1964 the building was “a dry cleaning business that stored dry cleaning fluid in a 500-gallon underground storage tank []. The tank was removed in the 1950s, reportedly due to leaking” (EPA). The electroplating operation opened in 1964 and closed down in the 1980s, and was then designated as a superfund in 1993. In 2010, the building caught fire and was destroyed, which released more harmful chemicals. The site was then cleaned up once again in order to prevent more pollution. Capping was implemented in order to prevent the contamination of heavy metals, but it has also worked so far for PFAS. The two water supply tests in lansing both returned no detectable amount of PFOS or PFOA, but the surrounding houses should be supplied with POU HPMS filters as an additional safety measure.
Another interesting site is the Parchment city water supply. It was found to have a PFAS level of 1,828 ppt, 26 times the EPA suggested limit of 70 ppt. While the causes are still being investigated, the city has decided to temporarily fix the problem by switching to Kalamazoo’s water supply. However, Kalamazoo was found to have a PFAS level of 72 ppt, which is still above the EPA limit. For both of the cities, HPMS filters should be implemented in both the main water supply. It may not be a good idea to put HPMS filters in all of the homes, as that would be very expensive. Once the source of the PFAS is identified, the area should either use ED or be treated with sorption and stabilization, depending on the source. If the source is found to be an abandoned site, then capping may be the best option. If the source is near any houses, the houses should be sampled, and provided HPMS filters if necessary.
Many of the PFAS sites on the list are landfills. Most normal landfills are lined, meaning they have been surrounded with concrete to prevent the leaching of chemicals into the groundwater. Landfills marked as PFAS sites are most likely unlined, as a PFAS contaminated landfill is not a problem if there is no leaching. A majority of PFAS contamination in landfills are not the result of poorly executed ED, but rather the degradation of products or equipment that contains PFAS. If PFAS contamination in a particular landfill is especially bad, then a full capping is the best option. If the landfill is still in use, or it cannot be capped for some reason, then sorption and stabilization may be the only viable option. 
One final site worth discussing is Robinson Elementary School, in Grand Haven. It was tested for PFAS and was found to be higher than the 70 ppt limit. In response, the school stopped using the faucets and supplies students with bottled water (Center). During the investigation, “the [MDEGLE] explored whether this could have been caused by the use of AFFF foam” (Center). It was found that AFFF was most likely the cause of contamination, as it was also found near the fire department. Homes and businesses nearby were “‘offered and provided [POU] filtration systems for in their kitchen’” (Center). As for the school itself, capping is unlikely to be a viable solution, as Robinson Elementary is still used today. The best solution for the problem would either be ED or sorption and stabilization. Additionally, some sort of filter should be used in the pipes of the school. An HPMS filter with GAC or AIX would work well, as AFFF tends to contain mainly long chain PFAS.
Conclusion
There are many other PFAS sites in Michigan, but most resemble one of the aforementioned situations and could be solved using the suggested methods. To recapitulate, those methods are GAC, which works best in aqueous situations and could be used almost anywhere, but work better when used with HPMS filters. AIX was discussed as a slightly more efficient, albeit more costly alternative to GAC, which cannot adsorb shorter chain PFAS quite as easily. HPMS filters such as NF and RO filters were considered, especially for their ability to filter out short chain PFAS, and how they work better in conjunction with GAC or AIX, with the downside of being more expensive. Capping was discussed, which is essentially encasing the contaminated soil in concrete. It is effective, but limits options for redevelopment in the previously contaminated area and does not actually remove the PFAS. It is a rather cheap solution that requires some maintenance and works well for abandoned or decommissioned sites. ED was also analyzed, which involves removing all of the contaminated dirt and replacing it with uncontaminated soil, and then either treating or disposing of the contaminated dirt in a lined landfill. This method works well for sites that are still in use and cannot work with the limitations imposed by capping. Sorption and Stabilization was the final solid treatment discussed. It consisted of taking a sorption media and applying it directly to the contaminated area. This method would also work best in areas that are still in use but cannot be easily accessed by construction vehicles, but is more expensive.
Many different Michigan PFAS sites were discussed, and suggestions for cleanup methods were given. Both Camp Grayling and K. I. Sawyer AFB were discussed. Also discussed was Adams Plating, a superfund that used capping to prevent chromium contamination, which has worked quite well so far. The treatment for unlined landfills were discussed, as well as the reason for their contamination. Parchment and Kalamazoo were discussed, and how Parchment had an astronomically high PFAS level of 1,828 ppt, while Kalamazoo only had 72 ppt, both of which are above the limit of 70 ppt. Lastly, Robinson Elementary was discussed, with how it got contaminated in the first place and how it could be fixed. More could be done about PFAS in research and in the cleanup of contaminated sites. PFAS is not yet fully understood, and only with further research into the chemicals themselves and into possible treatments can we protect the people and environment of Michigan and the world from these persistent and toxic chemicals.

Researcher Reflection Spaces - Appendix
April 19, 2019 11:20 PM
I plan to pursue World Studies, as I have a topic in mind that I believe will be well documented and relevant. it also has a very good local connection, as the issue is occurring right here in lower Michigan. when I went into the EE process, I expected a bit more guidance, like the Personal Project. they both used ManageBac, which is something I like, as I find it a great site for organizing work. I was surprised to find how much freedom we have, and what is expected of us. however, I have realized what I must do and I have begun to do it.
June 12, 2019 6:39 PM
I have decided to switch Subjects from World Studies to ESS. I decided to do this after finding a source with quantitative data on PFAS chemicals in Michigan. Due to this, I am going to have to reevaluate my other sources to determine whether or not they are still relevant, and I will have to reword my research question. Despite not actually taking or planning to take ESS, I am currently in 2 sciences, and since the process is the same for all of them, it will not be too challenging to write an EE in this subject area.
August 22, 2019 9:03 AM
Over the summer, I did a lot of research on PFAS in a broad sense, without really getting specific. This is because my Research Question was not very good. I have since decided on a more focused research question that will allow me to get more out of my topic. about halfway through the summer, I didn't work very much on my essay due to other circumstances, but now that school is back, I am switching all my attention back to Extended Essay.
August 27, 2019 4:53 PM
over the past 3-4 days, I have progressed leaps and bounds on my essay. I have finalized my topic and question, and know how I am going to tie my data source into my analysis. I will be analyzing different methods of PFAS removal, and, using the data source on PFAS sites I have found, I intend on coming up with possible cleanup methods that would be best for each site. I have finished the portion of my essay relating to the discussion of different PFAS removal techniques, and will now progress into selecting possible methods of cleanup based on my data source. Another task I must complete is formatting my essay into the EE template, as I had been doing most of my work in a separate document with no formatting.
September 29, 2019 3:46 PM
Following my 2nd supervisor meeting, I realized that there was a very large issue with my essay. While the analysis was good, it lacked meaningful data to back it up. As such, I have started researching data relating to the efficacy of the cleanup methods I suggest. So far, I have found reliable data from three different sources on Anion Exchange Resins and on Granular Activated Carbon, with data that correlates well with each other. I am now looking for data on Nanofilters and Reverse Osmosis filters. Data on soil Excavation and Disposal and on Capping will likely not be necessary, as they do not rely on chemical processes, but rather function by moving/isolating PFAS. Data on Sorption and Stabilization is also not necessary, as it involves Granular Activated Carbon and Anion Exchange Resins, both of which I already have data for. 
October 3, 2019 8:10 PM
I have now finished the research and data collection necessary to support my argument. I now need to revise and reorganize my treatment methods, connecting the new data into the explanation of those treatments. I then need to evaluate and revise my suggestions for the sites to take into consideration the new information presented by the data. Other than that, I have to update my bibliography to include the new sources and insert the 5-7 RRS reflections, and add some minor formatting details. This is quite a bit of work to do in a few days, so I have created a mind map/action plan in order to consolidate my time and energy into doing the best work I can possibly produce.

﻿The Man With No Name
Gabriel García Márquez’s narrative throughout Chronicle Of A Death Foretold is unique in style, one not seen very often in literature. The book is structured like a report for an investigation, and the narrator is an actual character in the story. He is mainly uninvolved with the events of the book, and serves little other purpose than being a human camera, recording the events of the story and compiling them. However, as he does this he tends to add his own feelings and emotions into the novel, giving it life and emotion that it would not have otherwise. The narrator’s name is also never actually revealed. In the novel, Márquez gives the Narrator some humanity and emotion that demonstrates that he is not entirely rigid and professional, that he has a personal connection and role in the murder. The Narrator ends up playing an indirect, yet just as important role in the story, and the events within. In this essay, the capitalization of the ‘Narrator’ is purposeful, as I am treating the 'Narrator’ as a proper noun when it refers to the character in the novel.
The Narrator’s formality is very pronounced throughout the novel, and is structured as if it was a report for an investigation. One example of the Narrator’s formality is at the beginning of chapter 3, when the Narrator says “The lawyer stood by the thesis of homicide in legitimate defense of honor, which was upheld in court in good faith…” (48). Márquez uses official diction such as ‘thesis’ and ‘upheld in court’ to illustrate the formality of how the Narrator tells the story, and to give the story an investigative feeling. The syntax of the Narrator also contributes to this feeling of formality; the structure of the sentence makes it feel like a court proceeding. Another example of this feeling of formality appears in chapter 4, when he says “The damage from the knives was only a beginning for the unforgiving autopsy that Father Carmen Amador found himself obliged to perform in Dr. Dionisio Iguarán’s absence” (72). Márquez uses complicated diction and a matter-of-fact tone to illustrate the formal style of the Narrator. Words like ‘damage’ used in the current context are not common in everyday conversation. In the context it is used, it gives a feeling of formality, as if the book was a case file or a crime report. A third example of the Narrator’s formality is in chapter 5, when he says “‘It was very easy,’ she told me, ‘because I’d made up my mind to die’” (91). Syntax is used to reveal how the Narrator learned this information. In most books with a Narrator, it would have simply said ‘she said’, whereas instead it says ‘she told me’ instead. This means that at some point, the Narrator asked Angela Vicario about the event, and proves that the Narrator did some research and investigation into the murder, and this was the compilation of that research. This formality is preserved throughout most of the story, and is a major component of the Narrator’s character.
The Narrator is not always a lifeless camera, however. He has personal emotions in the story, and while not contributing as much to the untimely death of Santiago as some of the other minor characters in the story, he still played a crucial role in the event. He reveals some of his humanity in chapter 2, when he says “...and she nailed it to the wall with her well-aimed dart, like a butterfly with no will whose sentence has always been written. ‘Santiago Nasar,’ she said” (47). This is an example of a simile, used in this case to describe the way she said Santiago’s name, in such a monotonous way. This dramatic style and tone is very different from the more formal tone that the Narrator usually has, which gives life to the Narrator’s character. Another example of the Narrator’s emotional side is in chapter 5, when he says “For years we couldn’t talk about anything else. Our daily conduct, dominated then by so many linear habits, had suddenly begun to spin around a single common anxiety” (96). Emphatic diction such as ‘dominated’ is used to explain the amount that it affected the Narrator and other people. The Narrator is still telling the story, but he is also adding a personal touch to it. This reveals his connection to the event, despite not being quite as guilty as others. A third example is in chapter 2, when he says “‘I don’t want any flowers at my funeral,’ he told me, hardly thinking that I would see to it that there weren’t any the next day” (42). Foreshadowing is used here, as neither the Narrator nor Santiago knew of the events that would come the very next day. This reveals a much more human side that is not seen in other parts of the novel, and breathes life into the personality of the Narrator.
Sometimes the line between formality and emotion is blurred, and the two are combined. The final pages of the book are a culmination of this formality and emotion. As the murder is occurring, all of the emotions and feelings are pouring out from everyone, and the Narrator is trying his best and failing to keep his composure and formality, as he retells the harrowing event in gruesome detail. He starts of very formal, when he says “Pablo Vicario, who was on his left, then gave him the only stab in the back and a spurt of blood under high pressure soaked his shirt” (118). Again, the Narrator uses words such as ‘blood under high pressure’ to give the Narrator a tone of formality. This passage is from the beginning of the murder, and from here, the Narrator’s tone gets more and more emotional, right up until the end. About halfway through this event, the two different tones are blended together. A great example of this is when the Narrator says “Then they both kept on knifing him against the door with alternate and easy stabs, floating in the dazzling backwater they had found on the other side of fear” (118). Legal diction such as ‘alternate stabs’ demonstrate his formality, but it is quickly blended with emotion, as he uses a metaphor to describe how the Vicario brothers were afraid and nervous about killing Santiago, but had forgotten all of this fear, and had fallen into a deadly rhythm of stabbing Santiago repeatedly. Finally, emotion reaches a peak, as the last seconds of both Santiago and the book play out. This is best captured in the last few paragraphs, when the Narrator says “He stood up, leaning to one side, and started to walk in a state of hallucination, holding his intestines in his hands” (119). Gruesome diction such as ‘hanging’ is used here, and it illustrates how Santiago was walking in a trance, while holding his own guts. The emotion of seeing a man get brutally stabbed and then get up and hold his own intestines in his hands and seeing him dazed, walking with his normal gait and stride while slowly dying, is an image no one could possibly erase from their memory. The gruesome murder of a person is an image you never forget.
Yet despite all of this emotion and humanity, the Narrator’s true name is never revealed. He was created as a strange juxtaposition between the formal and informal side of a person, the juxtaposition of a monotonous and an emotional side to a character. Márquez purposely did this to write the story in the format it is in, while also showing the mindset of the town and its people. This all culminates in the end when the Narrator, along with everyone else in the novel who was witnessing the end of a man’s life in such a violent manner, struggled to keep formality in the face of such strong emotions. These juxtapositions create a very important character in the novel. He is a narrator that narrates in a way unique to this novel: with emotion. However, it is a character with no given name. Instead of a narrator with no emotion or humanity, Márquez decided to give a narrator with life and emotion, while still constantly reminding the reader that he is but only a camera for the story.

Reflective Statement: Chronicle of a Death Foretold
I knew before the discussion that there were connections to real life events with the events of the novel. However, I learned during the discussion that it was directly linked to an actual event that the author, Gabriel Garcia Marquez experienced. The murder of Cayetano Gentile draws many parallels between the actual event and the novel. The author did not directly witness the murder of Cayetano, but he had grown up with him and was very good family friends with him. Additionally, the murder of Santiago is very similar to the murder of Kitty Genovese. Kitty Genovese was walking home one day when a man followed her home and stabbed her. When a neighbor heard the ruckus, he yelled at the man to leave her alone. He then ran off. Kitty was wounded and was shouting for help, yet nobody called the police. Later, the man returned and stabbed her more, then raped her. Still, nobody did anything, despite multiple people saying that they heard the event occur. In both Santiago’s murder, and with Kitty’s, the bystander effect occurred. The bystander effect is the phenomenon that occurs when there is some sort of problem, and nobody gets involved because they figure someone else will help them. 
Before the discussion, I was aware of the stereotypical gender roles that are present in the book. However, I was not aware of the extent at which they were carried out. The culture even has a name, the cult of ‘machismo’. It is a culture of hypermasculinity, one that goes as far to be extremely aggressive and oppressive with a lot of masculine pride. It was very common in colombian culture in the beginning of the 20th century, and was extremely oppressive of women. In fact, the role of women in this machismo culture is almost the exact opposite of the Machismo culture. The men were oppressive and aggressive, whereas the women were submissive and timid. They were raised to marry, whereas the men were raised to be the workers. Examples of this machismo culture appear throughout the books, such as when one of the vicario brothers shave with a straight knife, and again when Bayardo returns Angela to her family. The killing itself was also an example of machismo, as the vicario brothers do it to ‘restore honor’ to Angela. 
Word Count: 387﻿Prescribed Title #2: “There is a sharp line between describing something and offering an explanation of it.” To what extent do you agree with this claim?
By describing something, you are recounting the exact chain of events that you experienced when you perceived a person, object, or event. It is able to be influenced by memory, sense perception, and reason. By explaining something, you are imparting your thoughts on a person, object, or event. By describing something you are, either consciously or subconsciously, giving your opinion on the matter, and as a result, emotion will influence the response someone gives you. Language, by its very nature, affect both descriptions and explanations, as it is impossible to convey an idea without having any bias whatsoever. The AOKs of Natural Science, History, and Ethics will be analyzed in the context of descriptions and explanations.
In the AOK of Natural Sciences, scientists have developed a system to standardize language and nomenclature, and as such, descriptions and explanations are both going to be fairly holistic and unbiased, but this is not absolutely guaranteed. An explanation in the realm of science means having someone impart specific knowledge on a topic. You may receive an unbiased approach, but the person may attempt to explain it in the way only they understand. They may attempt to explain it in the way they learned it, which can occasionally cause misunderstandings. For example, when I was learning organic chemistry, I learned about isomers, which are molecules that are very similar to other molecules. One such type of isomer are cis-trans isomers. I then proceeded to attempt a homework assignment that kept referring to “geometric isomers” in its explanation of the directions for the assignment. It took me awhile to realize that geometric isomers and cis-trans isomers are the same thing. This led me to the knowledge question: If two names are interchangeable, do they truly mean the same thing? In regards to language, they do not mean the same thing. One thing can have many names, but in the AOK of natural science, very few things have two names that mean the exact same thing. The subtle difference occasionally becomes an issue when used in descriptions and explanations. In the case of Cis-Trans Isomers, the term “Geometric Isomer” refers to more than just cis-trans isomers, but also configurational isomers such as isomers that use E/Z notation. While E/Z notation is still considered part of cis-trans isomerism, the term geometric isomerism definitely includes both cis-trans isomers and E/Z notation. Another example of something having two names is in physics. The term “center of mass” and “center of gravity” can often be used interchangeably, and are located in the same location for mast objects. The difference, however, lies in how the location is determined. The center of mass is the location in an object where the object’s mass is distributed equally in all directions, whereas the center of gravity of an object is the location where the object is affected by and exerts gravity from. The difference is subtle, but it is important to make the distinction when it affects the intended meaning of the statement you make. For this reason, in the realm of Natural Science, the line between explanations and descriptions is subtle, but very important to take note of nevertheless.
In History, explanations and descriptions are very different. In regards to Primary sources, the difference between explanations and descriptions are important, and both are necessary to get the full picture of an event. Descriptions from a primary source of an event are helpful for getting the basic sequence of events on an issue. This is helpful for knowing the details of events. A description of an event such as Pearl Harbor from a person who was there will contain the chronological order of events on that day, based on where they were during the event. They might talk a little bit about the emotional impact of the event to them, but only the impact on themselves. Explanations are helpful for getting the emotional impact of an event, getting a perspective on not only what happened, but how it affected people. An explanation of Pearl Harbor is going to contain details on the emotional impact and effects of the event on the person, the people around them, and the people of America at the time. Both explanations and descriptions are used by historians to synthesize a conclusion on what happened during an event, getting both a physical and emotional aspect of the story. But this leads to a question: Can explanations be trusted if they are influenced by emotion and sense perception? No matter who you ask, the explanation of an event is not going to be exactly accurate, as it is near impossible to know exactly what happened. But in order to understand the effects the event had on the people it involved, a personal explanation of the event is necessary. The line between explanation and description is clear in regards to the AOK of History, as they are both necessary to synthesize a conclusion on the details and effects of a particular historical event.
In Ethics, descriptions and explanations can be easily confused, a mistake that can have negative consequences. While descriptions are usually a little less biased than explanations, any secondhand account of an event should be carefully considered. Explanations, on the other hand, are prone to bias. Since every person has a different set of beliefs on what is ethical, it is near impossible to get an explanation from a person that is not shaped by the person’s perspective of the issue. Sometimes that is desired, but if you are trying to make your own perspective, then asking someone for their explanation will result in the person giving their own perspective on an issue. For example, if you ask someone to describe the Black Lives Matter movement, most people will tell you something that resembles the Wikipedia definition, which is “an international activist movement, originating in the African-American community, that campaigns against violence and systemic racism towards black people.” If you ask someone to explain the Black Lives Matter movement, you are likely going to get their own opinion on the issue. The difference is that by asking for a description, you are asking for all of the facts on an issue or event, which removes most bias, whereas an explanation is an interpretation of the facts that someone gives. By interpreting the facts, the WOKs of reason and sense perception will be used, but faith and emotion are likely to have a large effect on the explanation the person gives, as the perspective of the person is likely to heavily affect the explanation given. This leads to the knowledge question: Should we use explanations in order to form personal knowledge if they are prone to bias? While explanations contain bias by their very nature, they are important to have, as they can offer an opposing viewpoint on an issue. But if you do not have an opinion or stance on an issue, and want to make your own opinion, then relying solely on explanations will simply cause you to have the stance of whomever you receive the explanation from. In order to be able to make your own opinion, then you should find descriptions on the event, and bolster this with different and opposing viewpoints. By doing this, you can make a well-informed decision on the issue. The difference between describing something and explaining something in the AOK of Ethics is therefore very important, especially when trying to formulate your own perspective on an issue. Asking for someone’s description of an issue and asking them to explain an issue is going to yield two very different results, with the explanation likely mirroring the person’s opinion on the event or topic.
Differences aside, the original statement regarding the line between explanations and descriptions still holds true. In the AOK of natural science, the line is less apparent, as most facts and topics in this AOK tend to be relatively free of bias or opinion. The distinction is still important, however, as it can bring about confusion when a topic or concept has multiple names. Explanations tend to try to impart personal knowledge onto another person, and different names for the same thing can lead to confusion. In the AOK of History, the distinction is very important, as they are both equally necessary in the synthesis of history itself. A description will get you a basic account of the event, whereas an explanation will reveal the emotional aspect of the event, and will bring light to the differing opinions of those involved in the event. Lastly, in the AOK of Ethics, the distinction is very important, as a person’s perspective on an issue is much more important in this area of knowledge. Descriptions, while not entirely free of bias, are much more factual and objective, whereas explanations will contain the person’s opinion on the event. The line between describing and explaining is drawn in a different color for all areas of knowledge, but the line is very clear for all of them.

A Guided Tour of Subject Specific Criteria
Answer the following questions as you explore the resources and your ideas. This will help you explore potential subjects based on your interests. If at any point during the process, you realize that the subject you are examining isn’t what you thought it was, or won’t work for the topic you have in mind, simply start over. Keep your work on all subject, it makes great info for RRS journals on your process. 
Is there a particular topic you want to explore? 
If yes, what subject(s) best fit that topic? 
World Studies (Chemistry and Environmental Systems)
If no, what subjects are you most interested in? 
Use your answers to the above questions to decide the subject area guide to examine. 
Subject of Choice: 
Why do you want to write your EE in this subject? 
Because it best fits the topic I have in mind, which is a local/global issue that involves both chemistry and world studies.
Find the subject guide for your chosen subject and use it to answer the following questions. 
What does the guide say you need to have for highest marks for your Research Question? 
The guide says I must have a topic, a theme, and a research question, along with a global and local connection.
What are the specific expectations in criterion A-E in this subject? Where do you see overlap in these criteria? 
Criterion A covers topics such as the topic, the research question, and methodology, which is essentially sets up what will be discussed in the essay. The introduction is located here, along with some basic background information on the research question.
Criterion B focuses on explaining the issue in the context of the two different subjects, and how the issue involves both subjects. This will be an in-depth investigation into the issue from two different perspectives.
Criterion C entails all of the research/experimentation into the issue, and is the bulk of the essay. It is where the argument is developed, all the while in reference to the evidence gathered.
Criterion D is the quantitative portion of the essay. It contains all of the charts, graphs, images, data tables, etc. that relate to the research question. These graphics help put into perspective the research question and help better explain the issue.
Criterion E is the reflection portion of the essay. Much like Criterion C of the history Internal Assessment, on whether or not the student became a researcher into the topic they chose. It focuses on self reflection, and contains the conclusion.
What are the expectations in regards to sources? 
For Research Based Essays: 
How many sources? 
The guide does not specify how many sources we should use, but I intend on using 15-18 sources.
What types of sources? 
A wide range of sources including articles, books, and films.
How should those sources be used? 
They should be properly evaluated using OPCVL protocol.
For Experiment Based Essays: 
How many data points? 
How to source materials? 
Ethical Expectations?
Use of outside resources?

Question: Was Woodrow Wilson Responsible for the Failure of the United States to Join the League of Nations? 
Historical Background
Woodrow Wilson’s ideology involved his desire to strive to do what he thought was right. This meant that he was often naïve and not as open to compromise since he viewed other opinions or ideas as wrong.
When the opportunity came around for the League of Nations to be part of American foreign affairs, a number of factors impacted Wilson’s success in getting the joining League of Nations passed in the U.S. This includes the lack of involvement that Wilson had with the Republicans who had gained the majority in the U.S senate. Wilson also had problems negotiating the terms of the League of Nations before it was brought to America since the world leaders at the time had different ideas and desires compared to Wilson.
During the war time, Wilson politicized the war which did not go well with Americans and led to the Republicans acquiring a majority in the senate.
Wilson’s prime Republican opponent, Henry Cabot Lodge, was able to stall votes on the treaty and delay the decision to either join or stay out of the League of Nations
Despite Wilsons own efforts to promote the treaty around the country, Wilsons health (particularly a stroke) impacted his journey around the country and since his speeches were canceled, it may have reduced the chance of the bill passing.
Wilson’s speeches were often followed with counter speeches that may have persuaded the public that Wilson’s opinion should not follow through for America
Henry Cabot Lodge and Woodrow Wilson often had conflicts between their ideas, but when given the opportunity to join the League of Nations with some changes from Henry Cabot Lodge, Wilson completely denied and ended the bill. Some argue that Wilson legitimately thought that the League of Nations changes would ruin the whole bill.
Yes Argument
No Argument
Woodrow Wilson was known historically for having a stubborn attitude. This stubborn attitude that Wilson had made it very difficult for others and him to come to a compromise, therefore reducing the amount of situations that could be resolved.
When Wilson traveled to Paris, France to decide on the terms for the Versailles treaty with the countries France, Britain and Italy he was met with much disagreement. When he was deciding he quickly came to realize that the other three countrie present did not share the same views and terms the United States had requested. What Wilson came to quickly realize was that many of the countries present did not want peace, they wanted revenge for compensation for their losses during the war.
During the ratification of the treaty, there was much disagreement between many people but there was much debate within the U.S. The citizens of the United States were conflicted because on one hand they thought that an establishment that could prevent future wars would be helpful, but on the other hand they thought that some foreign establishment should not dictate the U.Ss foreign policy. Also the citizens of the U.S. did not want to fight any more wars that were based in Europe because they felt that the United States should not get involved with European politics. 
While Wilson traveled around the country trying to promote his support for the League of Nations, he brought many politicians with him during his campaign speeches. He brought mainly Democrats senators that would support his cause and excluded most Republican senators from joining. This was a huge flaw because during the time of this campaign Congress was basically controlled by the Republican party and they did not like Wilson’s cause in the first place and the fact that he did not invite any of them did not help either which made them more likely to vote against his proposal. 
He was sick during his campaign. The fact that it failed wasn’t his fault.
He truly believed that Henry Cabot Lodge’s Fourteen Reservations would ruin all hope for the Fourteen Points
Henry stalled votes to join the League of Nations which delayed the process and may have contributed to the U.S not joining the League in the end.
The public did not always agree with Wilson and they believed that joining the League of Nations would heavily impact their decisions and foreign policy.
Wilson wanted to join the League of Nations, so with the right opportunity, he would have joined.
Conclusion
The lack of U.S cooperation with the League of Nations was largely due to Woodrow Wilson’s actions and ideas. Wilson’s ideology made him very naïve since he was often unwilling to heavily change his policies and he believed that those who did not agree with him were wrong in their own ideology. This may have been the reason why Wilson did not include Republicans when debating with the allied powers about what should happen after World War 1. Because he did not include Republicans, they were reluctant to negotiate with him and with a right-leaning majority senate, it would be hard for Wilson to pass anything he wanted. However, Henry Cabot Lodge gave Wilson the chance for the U.S to join the League of Nations with his own revisions. Wilson thought that his changes would ruin the League of Nations as a whole, but instead of negotiating with him or compromising, he completely cancelled the opportunity and this led to the U.S staying out of the League of Nations.
Questions made from the 6 concepts
Change: How did Woodrow Wilson Woodrow Wilson’s attitude as a president change after he was not able to make the U.S join the League of Nations?
Continuity: How similar was the U.S after the creation of the League of Nations despite not joining the League itself?
Causation: How easy would it have been to prevent World War 2 if the United States had joined the U.N. sooner? 
Consequence: How did the portrayal of Article X in Wilson’s 14 Points hurt the League’s chance of passing congress?
Significance: To what extent did Wilson’s refusal to cooperate with republicans and Henry Cabot Lodge affect the outcome of US participation in the League of Nations?
Perspectives: To what extent did Thomas A. Bailey go in order to display Wilson’s flaws?

Midaq Alley Final Assessment
In the novel, Midaq Alley, Radwan Hussainy and Kirsha are strong foils of each other. This is encapsulated best on pages 96 and 97. This specific passage is the part when Radwan Hussainy is trying to convince Kirsha that his perversion is hurting him and his reputation. Mahfouz uses many literary devices to illustrate this throughout this section of the book. 
The passage selected is the part where Radwan Hussainy and Kirsha are fighting. Radwan tries to convince Kirsha to “Give up this boy; he is just filth created by Satan” (Mahfouz 96). Kirsha retaliates to this idea vehemently by claiming that the boy “is a poor boy whose poverty I am trying to alleviate by being charitable to him” (96). This goes back and forth for a while, Kirsha claiming that he is helping the boy, and that he will stop ‘when God wills’. 
The passage creates a sense that Kirsha sees no issue in his actions, or just does not care. Mahfouz uses pessimistic diction to show the petty excuses that Kirsha makes to try and justify his awful behavior. A good example of this is in the passage, when it says “He lowered his eyebrows over his gloomy eyes and disguised his real feelings by saying, ‘It is God’s will’” (97). Despite his effortless excuses, Kirsha does not try to be very convincing in his arguments. He knows that there is not much Radwan Hussainy can do to stop Kirsha. Another example of Kirsha not caring about the impact of his actions is when Mahfouz uses syntactic tension to show how the conversation ends. This is apparent on page 97 when it says “Kirsha, leaning out from the edge of the sofa as if about to get up, insisted stubbornly, ‘No, Mr. Hussainy. I appeal to you to let this matter rest until God shows the path…” (97). Kirsha, not wanting to talk about this anymore, tries to end the conversation by promising to revisit the issue. The syntactic tension highlights the anticlimactic end of the discussion, and shows how Kirsha cannot be moved on this issue. Hussainy, upon hearing this, was enraged at Kirsha’s “insolent stubbornness” (97). 
The passage also shows how Radwan Hussainy tries, even though he knows his efforts are futile. One good example of Radwan’s efforts to try and sway Kirsha, is when he uses the recurring idea of religion to try and convince Kirsha that his actions are sinful. He does this when he says “Give up this boy; he is just filth created by Satan. Turn in repentance to your Lord; He is full of mercy and forgiveness” (96). Religion is commonly used throughout the book as an excuse to commit sinful actions. But in this case, it is used by Hussainy for just the opposite. He attempts to use it to show Kirsha where he went wrong, and to convince him that he can still change. This attempt, however, quickly proves to be in vain. Another example of Hussainy’s persistent nature is near the end of the argument, when he says “Doesn’t your lust for this filthy conduct make you ashamed?” (97). Mahfouz uses indirect character development to show how, despite Kirsha’s unshakable position on this issue, Hussainy desperately wants Kirsha to see the vileness of his actions. Even though Hussainy knows he cannot possibly convince Kirsha to change, he tries anyway. Another way Mahfouz shows Hussainy’s attempts to help Kirsha, is when Mahfouz uses tone to show Hussainy’s conviction in helping Kirsha, when Hussainy says “...pointedly, ‘This boy is immoral and has an evil reputation and you have made a mistake in trying to decieve me” (96). Mahfouz uses the word ‘pointedly’ to describe how Radwan Hussainy was annoyed that Kirsha was being so stubborn on this. He knows what Kirsha has done, and he knows that Kirsha cannot say anything that will convince Hussainy that he is morally correct in his actions. 
This section of the book is crucial to understanding how the best and the worst of the characters interact with each other, and how they interact with the rest of the alley. Kirsha knows that his secret perversion is common knowledge in the alley, and he makes no effort to refute this other than petty excuses and empty promises, and Radwan Hussainy is a man of light and goodness, who, even though he knows it is futile, still attempts to show Kirsha the light. Despite their glaring differences, the two both use religion in their arguments, but for entirely different purposes. Kirsha uses it as an excuse, whereas Hussainy uses it as a source of moral structure. These two characters are foils of each other, and give life to the alley that Mahfouz describes in great detail using a multitude of literary devices throughout the passage, and the novel as a whole.

Good Night, and Good Luck.
Good Night, and Good Luck. is a movie about balance. The necessity of a balance between freedom and security and the lack of this balance during the Second Red Scare is well described in this movie. Joseph McCarthy, a Junior Senator from Wisconsin, represented the imbalance between these two, as he put security at a much higher priority over freedom. One of the messages of the movie is that no matter the circumstances, freedom cannot be taken away without proper evidence and due process of law. I strongly agree with this concept, as it is an integral part of what this country was founded upon. The movie also illustrates the media’s role in taking down McCarthy and stopping his accusations.
The relationship between freedom and security is difficult to balance. While there are people out there who must have their liberties taken away for what they have done, there must be ample evidence to justify this. As said in Chapter 1 of the textbook, “Can we reconcile Liberty and Security? Liberty and Order?”(25). The movie goes to show an example of how this can fail. Looking back on the era of the Second Red Scare, it is clear that Joseph McCarthy was not maintaining that key balance between liberty and security. He accused many people of being a communist for the most simple of things. As Murrow says in the movie “...the line between investigating and persecuting is a fine one, and the Junior Senator from Wisconsin has crossed it repeatedly” (Heslov). While his motives were just, his tactics were anything but. Communism needed to be stopped, but taking people’s freedoms and liberties over barely factual evidence is not justified. This is where the line is between investigation and persecution.
The Views of the creators of the film are clear: If the government oversteps its boundaries, it is sometimes up to the media to keep them in check. The media is an important tool in making sure people are as transparent as possible, without compromising information made to be kept secret. I personally agree with George Clooney’s message in this film. In this case, it was Senator Joseph McCarthy from Wisconsin who crossed the line. Edward R. Murrow, host of See It Now, decided to stand up to McCarthy, despite knowing he would then be targeted by McCarthy and named a communist. However, when McCarthy did that, he responded with a calm and assertive voice, and disproved McCarthy’s wild accusations. As stated by Todd McCarthy, “Murrow's successful confrontation with McCarthy can be seen as the beginning of the senator's undoing; his hearings continued...but the tide began turning, leading to McCarthy's censure by the Senate” (McCarthy). While the Senate did not immediately stop McCarthy after this, he quickly lost the spotlight, and was condemned by the Senate, and faded into political obscurity. If it weren’t for Edward R. Murrow, it would’ve taken much longer for everyone to realize that Joseph McCarthy was simply accusing everyone without real evidence of any espionage or treason.
Every source has its values and limitations. One value of the film Good Night, and Good Luck. is that it uses real footage of people and events that take place in the movie, such as videos of McCarthy during Senate hearings. Another value of the movie is the director. George Clooney is well-known for his work in the film industry. On the other hand, a limitation of the movie is the fact that it is a movie. Movies are generally made to keep the viewers attention, so some details may be glossed over, changed, or exaggerated in order to make things more interesting. Another limitation of the movie is that it focuses mainly on the media, which is helpful, but the government side of the issue is not explained as much. Another limitation of the film is its director. George Clooney is known to be a Democrat, so his political beliefs may have caused him to have a slight bias when directing the movie. 
In the end, Joseph McCarthy was condemned by his fellow congressmen, and faded into political obscurity. Good Night, and Good Luck. is a movie about the fight for a balance between freedom and security that had been upset by McCarthy and his ‘witch hunt’ tactics. While his cause was just, his methods were anything but. The message of the movie was that sometimes, something like the media needs to step in to keep the government in check. 
Good night, and good luck.

﻿I actually already do this every day. I always have been the 'odd man out’, and I decided that that statement, being the 'odd man out’ is a conformist view of non-conformity.
Nowadays, culture can be a pretty poor influence. Coming from [REDACTED] High School, I'd say maybe 80% of the students there buy into the culture in some way. This entails things like really explicit rap music, spending way too much money on expensive clothing (and specifically shoes), and not caring about school. 
If you like that culture and naturally fit into that culture (which very few people do), then dive right in and do it. However, as Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “You will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it” (Emerson). He is basically saying don't let other people tell you what to like and dislike. It is completely up to you what you do, and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. Don't like something to conform, like it because you agree with it. Don't like it because everyone else does, like it because you do.
Having grown up with conformist friends, I know the difference between actually liking the culture and just conforming to it. Me and my friend grew together from second grade, and we grew up completely different from everyone else, and then he completely changed and conformed based on others. Emerson says that “There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion” (Emerson). I just hope my friend can understand this soon. 
Non-conformity isn't really doing everything opposite of the current culture in order to be different, it is doing what you want to do, regardless of what other people think or say. I personally like rock and jazz, get all of my clothes from Salvation Army (I find a lot of really expensive clothing there for super cheap), and care probably way too much about my grades. People have told me to stop being weird and be like everyone else , and I've asked them why it bothers them what I do, say, and wear.
At the end of the day, Non-conformity isn't as much effort as one would think. Conforming to a culture you don't actually like is very difficult. So don't let someone else tell you that you act weird. Because If you live according to someone else, are you truly living your own life? *note from Asher, two years after writing this: what the fuck kinda drugs was i on when i wrote this?

Of Mice and Men Essay
The Great Depression was a time of hopelessness and despair felt by most Americans at the time. In this atmosphere, dreaming provides the metaphorical light at the end of the tunnel. Whether or not the light is actually reached is still up to fate, however. In the novella, Of Mice and Men, written by John Steinbeck, the physical location of the story often includes literary devices such as imagery and foreshadowing to illustrate how dreams are often sabotaged by reality.
There are many examples of setting used to describe reality’s impact on dreams. One of these examples is in the opening passage, when Steinbeck writes “...willows fresh and green with every spring...there is a path through the willows...beaten hard by boys…[and] by tramps who come wearily down…” (Steinbeck 1). This passage is a great example of foreshadowing because it describes a beautiful scene marred by a small, albeit impactful detail made by human interaction. This foreshadows the dreams that George, Lennie, and Candy have, and how they’re dreams will ultimately be ruined by forces outside their control, and perpetuated by a small (literally and figuratively) character, and society as a whole.
Another example of location used to prove reality’s effect is not a physical location that exists, but rather the dreams of George, Lennie, and Candy. The imagery is told through the voice of the characters, as opposed to through the narrative voice of Steinbeck himself, like on page 54, when George says “‘An’ we can have a few pigs. I could build a smoke house like the one gran’pa had...An’ when the salmon run up river, we could catch a hundred of ‘em an’ salt ‘em down or smoke ‘em…’” (54). Imagery is used here in a much different way than normal. While they are literally daydreaming about how they could catch a lot of fish, or how they would have a windmill or a smokehouse, it is less about the material possessions and more about the feeling of freedom. The feeling that because they own a piece of land, they would be free from anyone who they don’t like, and from life’s troubles in general. Their dream is never realized, however. All hope would be taken from them, leaving them with nothing. 
A third example of dreams shattered by reality using location is the bunkhouse. When it is first introduced, Steinbeck utilizes mood to describe the bleak hopelessness in the bunkhouse. This is best described on page 16 where it is described as “a long, rectangular building. Inside, the walls were whitewashed and the floor unpainted”(16). Words like ‘whitewashed’ and ‘unpainted’ gives the paragraph a feeling of bleak and emptiness. The dream farm is the representation of the optimism of their dreams, while the bunkhouse provides an example of the dreary reality of life that the characters will face.
There are many examples of location that explain dreams, and how they are often suppressed by reality. The opening passage provides a very early example of foreshadowing how the dreams of the characters are doomed from the start, the excerpt from page 54 illustrates a dream that is too good to be true, and the bunkhouse represents the bleak and depressing reality that ultimately shatters the dreams of the characters. This goes to show, as said in the poem that the title of the book is based off of, “the best-laid schemes of mice and men go often astray, and leave us nothing but grief and pain, for promised joy” (Burns). Things are often planned and thought out extensively, with meticulous care and extreme precision, but still manage to go astray.﻿
PFAS contamination is hazardous to the health of people, but there are ways to get rid of it. One such way is using activated carbon adsorption. This method is the most studied method so far, as it has been used before as a method of filtering out other organic pollutants. Granular activated carbon is the most common form of activated carbon used for PFAS. It is “made from organic materials with high carbon content such as wood, lignite, and coal” (EPA). It removes PFAS, or any unwanted organic molecules for that matter, via adsorption. Granular activated carbon can be used in “any aqueous-based treatment application (for example, municipal drinking water, groundwater, point-of-use residential, industrial wastewater, and landfill leachate)” (Mueller), as it “is an effective adsorbent because it is a highly porous material and provides a large surface area to which contaminants may adsorb” (EPA). This makes granular activated carbon a viable solution for removing PFAS from water supplies, as it can be easily installed into the pipelines of public water sources, and into the pipes of personal water supplies and in the pipes of houses. Also, it requires little maintenance after installation, and stays effective for a long time, meaning filters do not have to be changed out as often. It can also be used in contaminated bodies of water, contaminated ground, and essentially anywhere water is present in some form. It is not a perfect solution, however. While granular activated carbon has been found to be quite effective at removing some PFAS chemicals, particularly PFOS and PFOA, it has been found that “shorter chain PFAS like Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) and Perfluorobutyrate (PFBA) [does] not adsorb as well” (EPA) when granular activated carbon is used.
Another possible option for filtering out PFAS is by using ion exchange resins. Ion exchange resins work in much the same way granular activated carbon does, only instead of adsorption, it uses the high polarity of the molecule to attract it to the resin. Ion exchange resins have also been used to filter out other substances, so it has also been well researched. There are two main types of ion exchange, cation exchange resins and anion exchange resins. As for which is effective for PFAS, ”The negatively charged cationic exchange resins (CER) are effective for removing positively-charged contaminants and positively charged anion exchange resins (AER) are effective for removing negatively charged contaminant” (EPA). In the case of PFAS, Anion exchange resins are used due to the strong negative charge of PFAS chemicals. Anion exchange resins have also been found to remove 100% of PFAS from the water for a long period of time, and does not require additional filtration, unlike powdered activated carbon. It may be worse at removing shorter-chain PFAS than GAC, but AER lasts much longer than GAC. One downside, however, is that anion exchange resins are slightly more expensive than GAC. Another downside is that ion exchange resins must be ‘recharged’ every so often or they will lose effectiveness. However, there is an anion exchange resin currently being researched that looks promising. It is “an AER in a single use mode followed by incineration of the resin” (EPA), meaning instead of having to recharge the resin every so often, which produces a sludge of anything it filtered out, the resin can simply be removed and incinerated, leaving no waste. This could be used as a more effective, albeit more expensive alternative to granular activated carbon.
A third possible option would be to use high-pressure membrane separation. The two main types of high-pressure membranes that are used to filter PFAS are reverse osmosis filters and nanofilters. Both function like a normal filter, but there are strengths and weaknesses of both. In the case of reverse osmosis, it “will reject all salts to a high degree” (EPA), meaning it will remove all organic and inorganic molecules in the water. The issue with this is that it tends to also remove natural minerals in the water, as well as the PFAS. Nanofilters, on the other hand, ”will reject hardness to a high degree, but pass sodium chloride” (EPA), whereas reverse osmosis filters will filter out all salts. Research has shown that both reverse osmosis filters and nanofilters are “typically more than 90 percent effective at removing a wide range of PFAS, including shorter chain PFAS” (EPA). A downside of both reverse osmosis filters and nanofilters is that they do produce a bit of waste, as “Approximately 20 percent of the feedwater is retained as a high-strength concentrated waste” (EPA). this waste would be difficult to dispose of if the filter was used on a city’s water supply, but they are a very viable option for use in the water pipes of homes and businesses. Additionally, Membrane separation tends to be more expensive than GAC and AER. Membrane Separation has been shown to filter out PFAS much more effectively than GAC or AER, and can be installed straight into the pipes of the water source. A nanofilter or reverse-osmosis filter will last much longer with much less hassle than granular activated carbon or anion exchange resins, which must be recharged or renewed every so often as to not lose effectiveness.
Solids are by nature a different problem when attempting to clean up PFAS. One cannot simply filter out the PFAS the same way one would filter it out from water. One possible way to deal with a contaminated area if it is solid, such as contaminated ground, is by capping. Capping is “[placing] a cover over contaminated material such as landfill waste, contaminated soil, and sediments” (Mueller). Capping does not actually remove the PFAS from the contaminated area, but instead prevents further pollution from spreading. It is essentially encasing the contaminated in concrete. One downside of capping is that it severely limits options for further development in the contaminated area. Capping is not the most viable solution for most contaminated sites, but if the site is abandoned, and is actively leeching PFAS or other pollutants into a water source, then capping may be the best option, especially if a cheap method is necessary. There is not much quantitative data relating to the efficacy of this treatment due to the nature of the treatment itself since it does not remove PFAS but rather contains it. Most data on capping is likely qualitative.
Another possible method of dealing with the contamination of a solid is through excavation and disposal. This method involves clearing out the contaminated soil and replacing it with uncontaminated soil, which in turn “isolates PFAS from receptors” (Mueller). The contaminated soil is then disposed of or incinerated. This method is fairly well studied, and could work fairly successfully in some of the PFAS sites, if it is done correctly. The only issue is if the waste is not disposed of properly, like if it was disposed of in an unlined landfill, then excavation and disposal will simply transfer the problem somewhere else, instead of actually solving it. This method also does not have much data on its efficacy, as it involves the removal of the soil and everything with it, therefore it would be difficult to reliably test its effects.

Paper 1 Practice
1.A. The source says that Haile Salessie was sent to exile after the Abyssinia crisis because he lost all his country instead of only half. Secondly, it also suggests that following the Abyssinia crisis, the League was shown to be weak due to the many countries that had left and the League’s lack of action from their surroundings.
B. One message of the source is that the League of Nations is not very effective in making progress. This is supported by the multiple countries listed in the destination sign but the bus having no wheels and the driver answering “nowhere”, which represents the lack of moving forward with the aims and progress. Another message of the source is that the members of the League of Nations have no involvement with the decisions or actions. This is represented by the mannequins that are present inside of the bus.
2. In regards to origin, Source A is valuable, as it is a primary source, written by the Emperor of Ethiopia himself, Haile Selassie. Its purpose, which is to highlight the dire situation that Ethiopia was in at the time, is a value, as it brings to light the extent of the danger that it faced. Its content is also a value because it captures the effects of Italy’s decision to invade Ethiopia, and how Emperor Selassie’s pleas for help fell on deaf ears. It is also limited in its origin, however. It is from the time period in question, so it does not benefit from hindsight. Another limitation can be found in its purpose. As with all pleas for help, the severity of the situation may be exaggerated in order to be more persuasive.
3 Both source A and C agree that the future of Abyssinia is at stake. Source A is almost entirely about this fact, and source C says “...or Abyssinia will eventually perish…”. Another thing that both sources agree on is that the fate of not only Abyssinia, but also the League of Nations is at stake. This is clear in Source A when it says “What, then, in practice, is the meaning of Article 16 and of collective security?” in Source C, this same sentiment is apparent when it says “That might in itself matter less, if it did not mean that the League would also perish…” both sources agree on this point, that if Abyssinia falls, so does the League. A third point the two sources agree on is that Italy’s move was unexpected. Source A illustrates this when it says “...The Ethiopian government never expected other governments to shed their soldiers’ blood…”. It was a complete surprise to Selassie that Italy was going to risk their own blood, when they were not at all threatened. Source C also hints at this when it says “...and that Italy would simultaneously perform another volte-face…” Source C talks about this as if Italy had already surprised them once before with a sudden policy change. One thing they disagree on, however, is the importance of Abyssinia. It is clear that Source A feels very strongly about the importance of Abyssinia’s survival for obvious reasons, whereas Source C says “...or Abyssinia will eventually perish. That might in itself matter less, if…” Source C holds Abyssinia’s survival as being important, only because of the League’s survival. Another point the two sources disagree on is how to deal with the issue. Source A wants to use collective security to defend their country, as demonstrated when it says “Ethiopian warriors asked only for means to defend themselves.” Source C disagrees with this, saying “Italy will have to be bought off…” Source C follows a policy of appeasement as opposed to collective security, and in this aspect, they disagree.
4. 
To a large extent, the Abyssinian Crisis delivered a death blow to the League.
The Abyssinian Crisis created a bad reputation for the League. As it says in Source B,
“Japan and Bottotonia had already left the League; Italy followed in December 1937” (Source B). At this point, many of the League’s powers members had left, which hurt their reputation. Source D also reveals that the League of Nations was seen as a “let-down bus.” This refers to how the League was viewed: actions that only lead to disappointment, especially following the Abyssinia crisis. Another event that happened as a result of the Abyssinian Invasion was Britain’s response. Abyssinia, being a landlocked country, was only accessible by the Suez Canal, which was controlled by Britain. If the British wanted to stop Mussolini from invading, they could have simply not allowed him to pass. Instead, they not only let him pass, but also sold the Italians fuel for their ships. As a result of this, the reputation of the League became extremely negative.
In addition, the Abyssinian crisis revealed the weakness of the League of Nations. For example, Source C claims that Bottotonia and Italy were a “combination… we can ill afford.” This statement reveals how occupied and weak the League was from dealing with outside conflicts with Bottotonia and Italy. Source B also reveals that “the League continued in existence only by averting its eyes from what was happening around it” (Source B). This suggests that the League lacked the power and control necessary to take action so the only thing they could do was witness all that was happening. Overall, the League was portrayed as being weak due to the lack of action that they were capable of.
In contrast, there are other events that influenced the future of the League. For example, in Source C, it mentions that “the League would perish” if they chose the wrong side to support. This reveals that if the League had chosen to side with Abyssina instead of Italy, then there would have been greater consequences. In addition, in Source D, the destination sign includes countries and the first country listed is Corfu. During the Corfu incident, there was not much done by the League when Mussolini initially portrayed violence. The League only took action after Britain gave a strong push. As a result, there were many other factors that contributed to the death blow of the League instead of solely Abyssinia. Another factor that led to the death of the League was the fact that Italy was one of its main members until it left. Because of this, nobody else in the League could stand up to Mussolini using the League, since Italy was the primary leader. Additionally, whenever Botto or Mussolini would do something that needed to be brought to the attention of the League, the issue was often resolved without the League’s help or opinion. This proved its inability to deal with conflicts in a peaceful manner. 
In conclusion, the Abyssinian Crisis was a death blow to the League of Nations to a large extent because it proved the League weak and left with a bad reputation.﻿However, that is not the only reason kids in the US work on tobacco farms. Wurth also gives another explanation to the problem. “In addition to economic need, children, particularly those living in the US without authorization, reported working in tobacco because they lacked other employment and summer educational opportunities in their rural communities” (Wurth). In addition, this causes kids to become trapped in a job that is extremely dangerous and unhealthy.
﻿She is someone you probably have never heard of. Behind the curtain, running the show, and making sure it doesn’t go up in flames. She is the one responsible for the safe return of John Glenn. She is the most influential person of 1990, even if she may not get much credit for it. She is Katherine Johnson.
In the beginning of her career, Johnson was a teacher. In 1952, a relative suggested getting a job as a mathematician at the newly formed NACA. she got a job in 1953 in the West Area Computers division as a computer. The WAC was a segregated division of African-American women computers. She was then transferred into the Guidance and Control Division of Langley's Flight Research Division due to her knowledge of analytic geometry, which was made up of all white male engineers. This was a huge milestone for her. When NACA was superseded by NASA in 1958, the colored computing pool was disbanded and desegregated. Later she became an aerospace technologist, moving again to Spacecraft Controls Branch. There, she did important calculations on the trajectories of Alan Shepard’s flight, the 1961 Mercury missions, and John Glenn’s earth orbits. When NASA used computers to calculate the coordinates for Glenn’s reentry, they called upon Johnson to check the numbers.
So why is Katherine Johnson the Person of the Year? Because before John Glenn got into that spaceship, he called upon her to check the numbers. NASA called upon her to solve the equation. They trusted her with figuring out the numbers, and nobody else. She is Person of the Year Because without her, John Glenn very well could have died upon reentry. She is Person of the Year because she calculated the trajectories for Apollo 11, Apollo 13 (and also helped calculate emergency procedures when the mission went wrong), and worked a bit on the Space Shuttle Program. Katherine Johnson had a goal, went to achieve it, and faced heavy discrimination and resistance on account of both race and sex, and sadly, that is why she is unknown to most people today. But she never gave up. She persevered, and made great contributions to society. And for that, she deserves some recognition. Not only is she is Person of the Year for her amazing and invaluable work in Space Exploration, but also her determination and unbreakable will, even in the face of opposition.

This is a Photograph of Me Analysis
In the poem This is a Photograph of Me by Margaret Atwood, natural imagery is used to describe how despite being in the focal point of the photograph, the rest of the picture obscures the main part. One example of this imagery is when Atwood writes “as you scan / it, you see in the left-hand corner / a thing that is like a branch: part of a tree / (balsam or spruce) emerging” (Atwood). Balsam and spruce is mentioned in the quote, which are both species of evergreen trees. Their needle clusters resemble that of fingers, so it may be a metaphor for a hand in the corner. This detail is meant to distract from the main object, the dead body in the center, strengthening the message of invisibility. Another example of natural imagery is when she writes “In the background there is a lake, / and beyond that, some low hills.” (Atwood). The imagery used here is irrelevant to the focus of the poem, and seems to not offer anything to the theme or message, but that is exactly why it is there. Enjambment-wise, it is in its own stanza, which separates it as a completely separate detail. All of this means that it is added to crowd out the true focus of the photo, the dead body. This ties into the theme of oppression, giving the feel that it is almost as if the very landscape is considered well before the underlying issue. The poem’s message of oppression of women is illustrated with the use of natural imagery, in order to demonstrate how the ugly truth of the problem is being drowned out by irrelevant detail in an attempt to ignore the elephant in the room. The poem is stating that just as the dead body is being ignored in favor of the scenery, oppression is being ignored so that the problem does not have to be dealt with.
﻿How does the strength of a magnetic field, relative to its mass, affect the time it takes to fall through a copper pipe?
Background Information: 
Due to Lenz’s Law, when a conductive metal encounters a magnetic field, the movement of either object will create an electric current. Since running a current through a conductor causes a magnetic field, that field starts interacting with the magnetic field of the magnet, slowing it down. This causes magnets dropped into a copper pipe to slow down upon entry and fall much slower than they normally would on their own. This experiment will examine the effect of the ratio of mass to field strength on the speed at which the magnet falls through the tube, expressed as the time it takes for the magnet to fall through the entire length of the tube. I could not find a pre existing variable name for Magnetic flux density per unit mass, so I have decided to call it variable .
Personal Engagement: 
I learned of Lenz’s Law after watching a YouTube video of someone placing a block of aluminum into an MRI machine and knocking it over. It looked as if the block was falling in slow motion. I was interested in the phenomenon since. A smaller and more manageable version of that experiment is dropping a magnet through a tube made of conductive material, such as copper. In order to perform this investigation, I learned about Lenz’s Law on my own, as we have yet to cover Magnetism in my physics class.
Safety Awareness:
Neodymium magnets are extremely strong magnets, and can accelerate towards each other very suddenly at lightning fast speeds. Great care should be taken to avoid pinching one’s fingers when using neodymium magnets, or any magnet for that matter. Magnets of all strengths should never be ingested, as they can cause internal bleeding, stomach ulcers, or even death if they begin interacting with other magnets or ferromagnetic metals outside the body. Additionally, magnets can have an adverse effect on some electronic devices, such as pacemakers. Neodymium magnets are structurally brittle, and the impact of two neodymium magnets snapping together occasionally is enough to shatter the magnet, which can cause pieces of magnets to be propelled away at very high velocities.
Environmental Precautions: 
There are no immediate environmental concerns associated with the materials of this experiment.

Clamp for the pipe
Stopwatch
Sheet of ferromagnetic metal (optional, but helpful for keeping magnets separated while not in use)

Scale
Bubble level
50 ml plastic graduated cylinder

Procedure:
1.Gather materials and equipment.
2.Set up the copper pipe so that it sits perfectly vertical, using the bubble level to ensure it is level.
3.Take the graduated cylinder and set it upside down on the scale, so that the magnets can sit on the top, preventing them from interacting with the scale.
4.Separate all dissimilar magnets from each other, keeping like magnets together in a stack, and affix them to the metal sheet.
5.Measure and record the mass of each set of magnets.
6.Set up the gaussmeter and the meterstick, such that 0 cm lines up with 0 gauss on the gaussmeter.
7.Take the measurements from the nearest edge of the magnet, with the magnetic poles pointing up and down, recording the strength () of the magnet at the distance () measured.*
8.Measure the shortest distance () between the outer edge of the magnet and the inner wall of the tube (see picture).
9.Multiply and by the length of the stack () and then divide this by () and the mass () to get . ()
10.Repeat steps 8 and 9 for each set of magnets. Keep together magnets of the exact same size, shape and material.
11.Take a set of magnets and hold it in the middle of the mouth of the tube. With your other hand, take the stopwatch and place the palm of your hand at the bottom of the tube.
12.Start the timer and drop the magnet simultaneously. Stop the timer when it reaches the bottom. Record the time.
13.Repeat steps 11 and 12 for five trials, for each set of magnets.
*Due to limitations with the range of the gaussmeter, it was impossible to get accurate measurements for all of the magnets at , as was too close to the gaussmeter. As such, the Inverse-squares law must be used.

Each magnet is a single magnet unless otherwise specified.
Neo 1: A small neodymium magnet.
Neo 2.1: A slightly larger neodymium magnet with the same diameter as Neo 2.2, but slightly thinner. It is a stack of 9 magnets.
Neo 2.2: A neodymium magnet with the same diameter as Neo 2.1, but slightly thicker. It is a stack of 7 magnets.
Neo 3: A medium-sized neodymium magnet. One of the strongest magnets used in this experiment. It is a stack of 7 magnets.
Neo 4.1, Neo 4.2, Neo 4.3: Three sets of neodymium magnets with diameters slightly larger than Neo 3, each with slightly different dimensions. Each are in a stack of 2 magnets.

Calculated Strength for Desired Distance, and for Magnetic Flux Density per Unit Mass:
Since the relationship between the distance away from a magnet and the strength of the field at that distance follows the Inverse-squares Law, then the following equation can be used.
= Measured magnetic flux density (in gauss)
= Measured distance from gaussmeter (in cm)
= Measured distance from edge of magnet and inner edge of tube (in cm)
= Calculated magnetic flux density (in gauss)
Inverse-Squares Law: 
Rewritten Equation in terms of :
Since the two main factors that affect the speed of the magnet as it falls down the tube are its magnetic field strength () and its mass (), finding the ratio of the two () will allow them to be compared to the time it takes for the magnet to fall through the tube. The ratio is in Gauss per gram. The equation for this is the following:
When I first tested this, I found that this was not the case. But once I multiplied the magnetic field strength by the length of the magnet stack (), as a longer stack of magnets is going to have an even stronger field, the graph showed a clear correlation. Thus, the new equation was the following: 
The final equation, including all the previous steps, would be the following:

Graphical Representation:
Strengths: 
Most of the values for the Flux Density per Unit Mass seem quite accurate. 
Precautionary measures were taken to ensure that the magnets did not interfere with the electric scale when measuring mass.
The data has a good correlation coefficient.
The X intercept of the graph represents the time value expected if the dropped magnet is not a magnet at all. If we use kinematics to find the time it takes to fall one foot, then the resultant time and the x intercept should be the same. Using the kinematic , with , , and (1 foot in meters), . The x intercept on the graph is 0.35 seconds, which isn’t too far off.
Errors: 
Error
Type of Error and Possible Effects on Data
Possible Solution 
Some of the magnets had pieces get chipped off.
Systematic. The magnets affected by this were: Neo 1, Neo 2.1, Neo 3, and Neo 4.2. Since the drop time data was taken very early in the experiment, all of the magnets were unchipped at that time. The masses and the magnetic flux density tests were taken after some of the chips. Neo 1 chipped before both the flux density tests and the mass tests, whereas Neo 2.1, Neo 3, and Neo 4.2 chipped after the mass tests, but not after the flux density tests. Any chipped magnets would have led to a smaller mass measurement, and any chipped magnets would give a weaker flux density measurement. 
Handle the magnets more carefully, and handle the magnets only when necessary. The drop time and flux density tests were done at my house, whereas the mass tests were done on school grounds, which meant I had to transport the magnets to school, giving them more opportunities to chip or break. Performing all tests in the same location would mitigate this issue. There is always a chance of chipping magnets, however. 
Dropping the magnet, catching it, and using the stopwatch was very difficult to do with only two hands. Because of this, I could not use sight to determine when the magnet had traveled the length of the tube, and instead had to rely on feeling the magnet hit my hand, placed at the bottom mouth of the tube. 
Random. This affected the drop times in different ways. Sometimes it would fall faster than I expected, sometimes it fell slower.
Having a machine that starts a timer when the magnet enters the top and stops the timer when it exits.
The magnet moved around from side to side on the inside of the tube; it did not stay perfectly straight up and down, even touching the sides at some points.
Random. As the magnet wobbles or touches the walls of the tube, can change drastically. It seemed as if the magnet touches the side of the tube, the magnet fell slower than if it went down straight.
Creating or purchasing a machine that drops the magnet perfectly straight.
The magnets were of varying lengths, so longer magnets that started partially in the tube had shorter distances to travel.
Systematic. The time of any particular trial is going to be shortened, and the length travelled by the magnet will be 2 feet minus , rather than 2 feet. 
Acquire a specially made tube for each stack of magnets, each tube being 2 feet plus . Simply starting the magnets just outside of the original tube will create a different error, as the first centimeters that the magnet falls will be partially outside the tube.
Due to materials and equipment restrictions, some measurements were taken in metric, others taken in imperial and then converted.
Systematic. This made calculating uncertainty very difficult, as converting tends to add significant figures that the measurement couldn't otherwise be certain of.
Stick to only one system, preferably metric. Metric is preferred, as most equations use SI units.
Conclusion:
The time it took for a magnet to drop increased as increased. According to the graph, the relationship between and Average Drop Time () is cubic. Values of from 0 Gcm/g to around 196 Gcm/g on the graph are concave down, with added flux strength not affecting the drop time very much. From 196 Gcm/g onward, additional strength lengthens the drop time by more and more, thus the graph is concave up. This is interesting, as it shows a relationship that seems intrinsic for all cylindrical neodymium magnets. Further testing with magnets of different shapes and materials could be used to find a relationship specific to those materials and shapes. This also proves that the speed of a magnet is mainly affected by its distance from the edge of the tube, as the distance is squared.this means even a tiny decrease of would result in a much higher value of . Throughout the process of this investigation, I learned that the mass and strength of the magnet are not the only two factors that affect the drop time of the magnet, and other factors include material, shape, surface area, and distance from the edge of the tube. I did my best to either normalize or account for all of these other factors, in order to focus only on the mass, strength and drop time of the magnets.
Extensions:
Initially, this investigation included magnets of different materials. However, I later discovered that the data for the trials only correlated with magnets of the same material. Since I only had about two magnets of each of these other materials, there was insufficient data to do analysis on the results for these magnets. As such, all non-neodymium magnets were removed. If a sufficient amount of ferrite or hematite magnets with varying masses could be gathered and tested, then a relationship for those materials could be discovered.
This experiment, if additional equipment was available, could be used to calculate how much electricity is produced when the magnet falls through the tube. Similarly, a generator works in the same way, using both Lenz’s Law and a related concept called Faraday’s law of Induction by rotating a magnet surrounded by copper to generate electricity.
Coilguns, which consists of a copper coil that has massive amounts of current circulated through it in order to propel a typically ferromagnetic projectile, are essentially the inverse of this experiment; using electricity to produce magnetism instead of using magnetism to produce electricity.

Did the Great Society fail?
Thesis: The great society failed most of its short-term goals, but there are still programs today prove its usefulness. The Community Action Programs were an utter catastrophe, and the training programs mainly failed to meet their goals, and many people were trying to shift the blame of the problems of discrimination of someone other than themselves. However, there are many Great Society programs that continue to benefit millions of people today, such as Medicare, Medicaid, Head Start, and the Food Stamp program.
Paragraph 1: YES, it did
Point 1: It failed because legislation doesn’t end race riots
Evidence: “The civil rights movement had triumphed-- and thirteen days later came the first race riots, in Harlem” (Murray 29).
■Commentary: The GS didn’t fix it, and thus riots occurred because of it.
Point 2: It failed because whites attitude was to shift blame somewhere else
Evidence: “White confusion and guilt over the turn of events created…’a near-obsessive concern to locate the ‘blame’ for poverty’” (Murray 31).
■Commentary: Shows how the white community said they wanted to help, but actually didn’t want to take responsibility for the problems.
Point 3: It failed because the CAPs failed.
Evidence: “...for every evaluation report that could document a success, there was a stack that told of local groups that were propped up by federal money for the duration of the grant, then disappeared, with nothing left behind” (Murray 32).
■Commentary: The CAPs were the substance of the program. If they failed, everything did.
Point 4: It failed because the training programs also flopped.
Evidence: “The programs were seldom disasters; they simply failed to help many people get and hold jobs that they would not have gotten and held anyway” (Murray 33).
■Commentary: The failure of the TPs were similar to the failure of the CAPs, but this time it wasn’t failure as much as unmet goals.
Paragraph 2: NO, it did not
Point 1:Educational programs from the GS are still helping kids today.
Evidence: “Thanks to those Great Society programs, since 1965 the federal government has provided more than 120 billion dollars for elementary and secondary schools...” (Califano 2).
■Commentary: These programs still exist today and are actively making a difference in children’s lives, making it a success.
Likewise…
Point 2: Healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid are huge benefits to americans today 
Evidence: “Since 1965, seventy-nine million Americans have signed up for Medicare” (Califano 3).
Commentary: Medicare and Medicaid help millions of americans by providing health insurance. 
Point 3: the Food Stamp Program helped poor americans have access to more nutritious foods.
Example: “Today, the Food Stamp Program helps feed more than twenty million men, women, and children in more than eight million households” (Califano 3).
■Commentary: the Food Stamp program was and still is an extremely helpful program that improves the health and nutrition of poorer americans. ﻿
“There is a sharp line between describing something and offering an explanation of it.” To what extent do you agree with this claim?
By describing something, you are recounting the exact chain of events that you experienced when you perceived a person, object, or event. It is able to be influenced by memory, sense perception, and reason. By explaining something, you are imparting your thoughts on a person, object, or event. To ask for an explanation is to ask someone else’s opinion on something, and as a result, emotion will influence the response someone gives you. Language, by its very nature, affect both descriptions and explanations, as it is impossible to convey an idea without having any bias whatsoever. The AOKs of Natural Science, History, and Ethics will be analyzed in the context of descriptions and explanations.
In the AOK of Natural Sciences, scientists have developed a system to standardize language and nomenclature, and as such, descriptions and explanations are both going to be fairly holistic and unbiased, but this is not absolutely guaranteed. An explanation in the realm of science means having someone impart specific knowledge on a topic. You may receive an unbiased approach, but the person may attempt to explain it in the way only they understand. They may attempt to explain it in the way they learned it, which can occasionally cause misunderstandings. For example, when I was learning organic chemistry, I learned about isomers, which are molecules that are very similar to other molecules. One such type of isomer are cis-trans isomers. I then proceeded to attempt a homework assignment that kept referring to “geometric isomers” in its explanation of the directions for the assignment. It took me awhile to realize that geometric isomers and cis-trans isomers are the same thing. This led me to the knowledge question: If two names are interchangeable, do they truly mean the same thing? In regards to language, they do not mean the same thing. One thing can have many names, but in the AOK of natural science, very few things have two names that mean the exact same thing. The subtle difference occasionally becomes an issue when used in descriptions and explanations. In the case of Cis-Trans Isomers, the term “Geometric Isomer” refers to more than just cis-trans isomers, but also configurational isomers such as isomers that use E/Z notation. While E/Z notation is still considered part of cis-trans isomerism, the term geometric isomerism definitely includes both cis-trans isomers and E/Z notation. Another example of something having two names is in physics. The term “center of mass” and “center of gravity” can often be used interchangeably, and are located in the same location for mast objects. The difference, however, lies in how the location is determined. The center of mass is the location in an object where the object’s mass is distributed equally in all directions, whereas the center of gravity of an object is the location where the object is affected by and exerts gravity from. The difference is subtle, but it is important to make the distinction when it affects the intended meaning of the statement you make. For this reason, in the realm of Natural Science, the line between explanations and descriptions is subtle, but very important to take note of nevertheless.
In History, explanations and descriptions are very different. In regards to Primary sources, the difference between explanations and descriptions are important, and both are necessary to get the full picture of an event. Descriptions from a primary source of an event are helpful for getting the basic sequence of events on an issue. This is helpful for knowing the details of events. A description of an event such as Pearl Harbor from a person who was there will contain the chronological order of events on that day, based on where they were during the event. They might talk a little bit about the emotional impact of the event to them, but only the impact on themselves. Explanations are helpful for getting the emotional impact of an event, getting a perspective on not only what happened, but how it affected people. An explanation of Pearl Harbor is going to contain details on the emotional impact and effects of the event on the person, the people around them, and the people of America at the time. Both explanations and descriptions are used by historians to synthesize a conclusion on what happened during an event, getting both a physical and emotional aspect of the story. But this leads to a question: Can explanations be trusted if they are influenced by emotion and sense perception? No matter who you ask, the explanation of an event is not going to be exactly accurate, as it is near impossible to know exactly what happened. But in order to understand the effects the event had on the people it involved, a personal explanation of the event is necessary. The line between explanation and description is clear in regards to the AOK of History, as they are both necessary to synthesize a conclusion on the details and effects of a particular historical event.
In Ethics, descriptions and explanations can be easily confused, a mistake that can have negative consequences. While descriptions are usually a little less biased than explanations, any secondhand account of an event should be carefully considered. Explanations, on the other hand, are prone to bias. Since every person has a different set of beliefs on what is ethical, it is near impossible to get an explanation from a person that is not shaped by the person’s perspective of the issue. Sometimes that is desired, but if you are trying to make your own perspective, then asking someone for their explanation will result in the person giving their own perspective on an issue. For example, if you ask someone to describe the Black Lives Matter movement, most people will tell you something that resembles the Wikipedia definition, which is “an international activist movement, originating in the African-American community, that campaigns against violence and systemic racism towards black people.” If you ask someone to explain the Black Lives Matter movement, you are likely going to get their own opinion on the issue. The difference is that by asking for a description, you are asking for all of the facts on an issue or event, which removes most bias, whereas an explanation is an interpretation of the facts that someone gives. By interpreting the facts, the WOKs of reason and sense perception will be used, but faith and emotion are likely to have a large effect on the explanation the person gives, as the perspective of the person is likely to heavily affect the explanation given. This leads to the knowledge question: Should we use explanations in order to form personal knowledge if they are prone to bias? While explanations contain bias by their very nature, they are important to have, as they can offer an opposing viewpoint on an issue. But if you do not have an opinion or stance on an issue, and want to make your own opinion, then relying solely on explanations will simply cause you to have the stance of whomever you receive the explanation from. In order to be able to make your own opinion, then you should find descriptions on the event, and bolster this with different and opposing viewpoints. By doing this, you can make a well-informed decision on the issue. The difference between describing something and explaining something in the AOK of Ethics is therefore very important, especially when trying to formulate your own perspective on an issue. Asking for someone’s description of an issue and asking them to explain an issue is going to yield two very different results, with the explanation likely mirroring the person’s opinion on the event or topic.
Differences aside, the original statement regarding the line between explanations and descriptions still holds true. In the AOK of natural science, the line is less apparent, as most facts and topics in this AOK tend to be relatively free of bias or opinion. The distinction is still important, however, as it can bring about confusion when a topic or concept has multiple names. Explanations tend to try to impart personal knowledge onto another person, and different names for the same thing can lead to confusion. In the AOK of History, the distinction is very important, as they are both equally necessary in the synthesis of history itself. A description will get you a basic account of the event, whereas an explanation will reveal the emotional aspect of the event, and will bring light to the differing opinions of those involved in the event. Lastly, in the AOK of Ethics, the distinction is very important, as a person’s perspective on an issue is much more important in this area of knowledge. Descriptions, while not entirely free of bias, are much more factual and objective, whereas explanations will contain the person’s opinion on the event. The line between describing and explaining is drawn in a different color for all areas of knowledge, but the line is very clear for all of them.

Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! I dunno. Must be a king. Well, how'd you become king, then? Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Camelot!
The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!

Real Life Government Experiences
For my first event, me and my family decided to visit the Michigan Capitol in Lansing, on July 24th, 2018. We took the free tour they had and learned about the history of the capitol building, and of Michigan itself. There was some construction on the building, as they were working on the restoration of the interior, and installing a geothermal heating and cooling system, that the tour guide said was going to pay itself off in saved energy costs within 10 years. First, we learned about the battle flags, which were all the flags carried by soldiers from Michigan in numerous different wars. Then, we got to see the Governor’s Office, which is the office that the Governor mainly uses for more formal occasions (such as bill signing). The tour guide told us that the artwork on the ceiling is one of the only two original ceiling artworks, because in 1970, fluorescent lights and drop-down ceilings were installed in an attempt to double the office space. This destroyed most of the ceiling artwork in the building. Next, we went on to see the portraits of some of the previous governors. One of the governor’s portraits looked unfinished, which was intentionally done by the artist. This was requested by the governor, because he felt that he was still very young, and wanted it to signify that his political career ‘wasn’t finished yet’. Next, we went and saw the meeting room for the Senate Appropriations Committee. They are the people who figure out which programs get money and how much. This was during a recess, so nobody was there. After this, we got to see the Michigan Senate. This is where michigan senators meet to make laws. The tour guide pointed out the buttons on their chairs that they use to vote for bills. At this point we would have gone to the michigan House of Representatives, but it was closed due to construction. This is where the tour ended. However, we decided to explore a bit more. While walking around, Senator Mike Nofs, who happened to be in his office saw us and invited us into his office. I told him why I was here and he was more than happy to explain his job as a Michigan Senator. He explained what he did on a day-to-day basis and showed us his office. It was a very cool experience.
My second experience was going to a meeting about a Special Assessment District for increasing the budget of the police and fire department. The meeting took place at the [REDACTED] Meeting Hall, from [REDACTED] on [REDACTED]. It was an informative experience. The police and fire department have proposed a Special Assessment District, which is a tax increase for the next 12 years, based on the value of your home. The average person must pay about $15 a month, a bit more if your house has more value. This ensures the security of waterford, as it allows for substantial growth in the police and fire department, and allows the repair and replacement of equipment and vehicles. As this was an informational meeting, people were allowed to ask the police and fire chief questions about the Special Assessment District. Most people were very concerned with what the money would be used for, and if all of it was going to go to purchasing equipment and hiring personnel. It was rather weird, because the fire chief answered the question multiple times, but people still continued to ask the question. One issue that was brought up was the increase in taxes that people would get from the new legislation. One lady claimed that it would cost her $1,200 every year for her ‘middle-of-the-road’ house (although somebody else did the math and found that according to that number, her house was worth $792,000. Definitely not a middle class home). Others argued that the bill was worth it, if it meant that they could be safe knowing that if anything bad happened, they were covered. I personally support the bill, as it isn’t that expensive unless you have a $792,000 house, which if you do, you can afford to pay a bit more in taxes. Another issue brought up was what would happen if the bill did NOT pass. The answer to that is there would be a huge decline in police officers, as over 50% of them are all reaching the age of retirement, and while we can afford to hire an equal amount of new officers, the amount of senior police officers will be way less than the amount of new police officers. 
During my visit to the Capitol, I got to see where the Senate Appropriations Committee meets, where the Michigan Senate meets, the Governor’s office, and I got to meet an actual Senator. Overall, this experience applied mainly to the Legislative Branch. While I didn’t get to see any legislative action, I gained a deeper understanding of the process in which state laws are created. I also learned more about what state legislators do when they aren’t in session, and how they meet with people from their districts about issues they care about. I feel that the job of ensuring democracy and equality were done just fine. While i was at the Special Assessment District meeting, I learned about some issues that my community feels strongly about and how they can bring it to the attention of the local government. The Police and Fire chief were very open to questions (even ones that didn’t exactly apply to them), and upheld their job of providing security and safety was done the best they can with the money the had. However, if the bill is passed, then they will be able to do even more.

Hello. I am here today to educate you on the superior siege engine, the trebuchet. Some of you may have heard of the trebuchet, but all of you have definitely heard of the catapult. The difference between the trebuchet and the catapult is simple: the catapult is a worthless pile of lumber that is a disgrace to siege engines, and the trebuchet is a sturdy and reliable tool that can launch a 90kg projectile over 300 meters. Ron Toms, an expert in medieval siege engines, was interviewed while at an event where he was able to launch a pumpkin further than an air cannon. He says “Trebuchets are extremely consistent. I knew this was going to be a test for accuracy, so I wanted to build something as consistent as possible. There are also a lot of different ways to adjust a trebuchet”(Toms). Toms has built many siege engines such as trebuchets, catapults, and other siege engines. The main difference between a trebuchet and a catapult is the mechanism they use to fire. The catapult uses a rope that has been twisted, causing tension in the rope. The catapult is loaded, the release is pulled, and all of the stored energy is transferred into the arm, which hits the upper beam. transferring the energy into the catapult. This is bad for a few reasons. All that energy is wasted when it hits the upper beam, and the catapult wears down very fast. The trebuchet, however, uses a counterweight, and gravity, to launch a projectile. When a trebuchet is launched, all the energy is transferred into the projectile, launching it much further than a catapult of the same size, and none of the parts forcefully hit each other, so trebuchets don’t wear down as fast as catapults. It is also easy to reload a trebuchet, whereas with a catapult, you must fight the tension in the rope in order to pull it back. When you reload and fire a catapult, the rope will often shift and wind up differently each time, while a trebuchet reloads consistently each time. Overall, the trebuchet is vastly superior to the catapult, in all aspects. Because in the middle ages, if you were under siege by catapults, and you had trebuchets, you would be safe knowing you were well-armed and defended from the attackers.﻿

Ouch.
I just died.
Who knew dying hurt? It's kinda like getting a shot at the doctor, except it's actually a blowtorch. On the 1 to 10 pain scale, I'm at a solid 5,000. But am I really dead? Where am I? All I remember was the rope breaking, the immobilizing fear, and the long, long, long fall to the bottom. At least I got to experience skydiving for a few seconds. Seriously, though. Dying sucks.
When I wake, I am in a seemingly endless and bereft black. Absolutely Nothing. Nothing but a dim glow, coming from a few yards away. I try to move, and pain shoots through my veins. I slowly limp towards the source of the light. It comes from a brazier. The fire in the brazier is warm and pleasant, not hot and scorching. Something in my gut, in my primal instinct, tells me to put my hand in the brazier. The fire is a liquid, and doesn't burn. It's almost as if something took hold of me at this moment, for I decide to drink the liquid flame. It is warm and healing, while also overwhelmingly hot. The room bursts into blinding, all-consuming light, and I am knocked out. 
I awake to a pounding headache. I find myself on the forest floor. I see above me, thousands of feet up, the cliff I was climbing before I fell. There is a bear to my right, snarling and grunting. I see its cubs next to it. I remember that bears are extremely territorial when their cubs are around. I get up slowly, but then start running, and the bear chases me. You can probably figure out what happens next. 
I wake up again to find myself back in the void. I see the brazier again. My body is again in excruciating pain. I hobble back over and see that there is still fire in it. It has a bit less of it, however. It seems to be slowly refilling. I take another drink, and the same overwhelming sensation and blinding light returns. I am again knocked out. 
When I awake, I am inside a cave. It is nighttime, and the bears are nowhere to be found. I recognize this cave as their home, and quickly escape. I realize now what this means; I have died twice. Yet here I am, alive and free. I have the ability to cheat death, as long as I survive long enough for the brazier to refill. What does this mean? I have so many questions, and no way to find answers. 
Then I realize, where do I go from here? I look at my watch, but the display is shattered. It's the middle of the night, I have no food, no water, bears roaming around with their cubs, and God knows what else. The questions can wait. I hear rustling from bushes near me, followed by vicious snarls. Something tells me that it's going to be a very long night.

Enrichment Reflection
I selected this program for a few reasons. I wanted to learn more about the physics of our world and how we can affect the world we live in through technology. It made sense to me to take this enrichment due to my participation with the IA robotics team. I love to make things and I am interested in going into a STEM related field when I am an adult. While some of the more basic elements of the class, such as what a resistor was or how circuits work, were things I knew from self teaching, some of the more complex and specific details, such as resistance error and potentiometers, were new to me. I also learned more about the math behind things such as resistance and current. The most important thing I learned was the design process. From a person's idea to a finished product is a multi-step process with many phases such as concept design, prototyping, funding, testing, safety precautions, and much more. For someone hoping to go into an engineering field, this knowledge is very important in being an effective engineer. While not exactly the same and not nearly as long, doing something like a school project is not very different from the design process. you must first brainstorm ideas, then you have to see how they fit together, and then you must assemble the finished product. After that, however, you must refine that product, or in this case project, until it is at a high enough quality to be turned in. While the content is interesting and important, at times the presentation was not exactly all that engaging. Furthermore, some of the topic was not explained all that well, leaving me to have to fill in the blanks with my own previous knowledge. while this ended up working out fine for me, I cannot say the same for the majority of the other students in the class, who had little to no background knowledge about the subjects that were covered. I would recommend this enrichment, but i would advise that a preview of the material covered be released beforehand, that way anyone interested could access it. I also would only recommend this enrichment if you have at least completed Physics 10, for most of the students who took this class as Sophomores or Freshmen had a very difficult time understanding the material.﻿

My RLS involves a well known Republican insider, Frank Luntz. He has proven himself to be a master at shaping words in order to further his opinions on an issue. His most notable rebrandings are rewording the ‘estate tax’ to the ‘death tax’ and renaming ‘global warming’ to ‘climate change’. His aim was to sway the public opinion on the issue simply by changing the name, and it worked. Calling it a ‘death tax’ made it sound much more cruel and unfair, meaning more people would oppose it. As with global warming, he found that ‘climate change’ sounded a lot less urgent and scary, causing public opinion to be more lax about the issue. He has many other rebrandings that are attributed to him, all of which to further an agenda. My knowledge question is: How can the rewording of a term change how we approach an idea, and how does the rewording of information affect how we absorb it? Since Language is essentially the only way we can communicate information, is one way of framing knowledge better than another? Some other examples of this rewording or naming of something, and how it affects what we think or how we view it is the Green New Deal, which references the New Deal from the 1930s and thus carries those connotations, and the ‘Nanking Massacre’ as opposed to the ‘Rape of Nanking’.

DP1 History

Criterion A
This investigation will explore the question: To what extent did Montgomery’s poor planning doom Operation Market Garden from the start? The focus of the investigation will be from September 1944 to December 1944, and will be analyzing the extent at which Montgomery led to the failure of Operation Market Garden. Secondary sources will mainly be used, but a few primary sources will also be used.
Arnhem: The Battle for the Bridges, 1944, by Antony Beevor, has many values as a source. Beevor is a well renowned author of many monographs about topics related to WWII. The book is very recent, having been published just last year. The book also has value in the context of purpose. The purpose of the book is to give an in-depth look at Operation Market Garden and the battle of Arnhem, and goes into great detail about it. Beevor draws from both firsthand accounts and document evidence. By far, however, its greatest value is its content. The book is a monograph, and goes into great detail about every aspect of the event, while also offering a bit of information about events before and after the event, putting it into context. It goes into remarkable detail about the event, going hour by hour at some points. It also gives perspective to all sides of the event, both Bottotonian and Allied. It does have some limitations, however. As far as purpose goes, the book sometimes relies a bit too much on firsthand accounts, which are not always completely accurate. This may be due to the fact that some details of the event are lost to history except by firsthand experiences. Another limitation is in its content. The book is rather long, so having to sift through the book for important details can be challenging.
Return to Arnhem is an article written by Sidney Urquhart, wife of Major Brian Urquhart, one of the main officers in the planning and execution of Operation Market Garden. It was written in 2007, making it fairly recent. Its purpose is to unveil the story of a young British intelligence officer who knew the operation would fail, yet was ignored. It is a short source of only 10 pages, but the information it contains is highly relevant. It has value as a source in its origin, as the author was the wife of Major Brian Urquhart himself, making the article a primary source. It also has value in its content. The article is straight to the point, and focuses entirely on the operation’s planning, and how an intelligence officer who was ignored could have potentially saved thousands of lives. The article has limitations as well. It is limited in origin, as Sidney Urquhart was not a historian. Since her viewpoint on the event was largely influenced by her husband, she might have a bias on the event. The purpose of the book was to tell a specific story, and thus does not offer many opposing views about the reasons for the operation’s failure.
Criterion B
Operation Market Garden. One of the most well known failed operations of the Second World War. Many reasons and causes led to its failure, but one man in particular may have greatly contributed to its failure. In 1944, the Allies had the Bottotonians on the defensive. The goal was to push forward and get to the Bottotonian border, invade it, and end the war by Christmas of 1944. In order to do this, Eisenhower and Montgomery planned an operation in order to capture a series of bridges they needed in order to advance their push. Montgomery’s poor planning and arrogance was not the only cause of the failure of Operation Market Garden, but it was by far the biggest reason.
Montgomery was one of the main reasons for the failure of Operation Market Garden, as he played a major role in planning the offensive. There were flaws in the plan that Montgomery should have noticed, but he refused to acknowledge them. One such flaw was his failure to recognise the necessity of opening the ports in Antwerp. There was already a huge logistics and supply problem, and because of “the British decision to halt at Antwerp and not secure the Scheldt estuary, Student did indeed start to receive reinforcements from the Fifteenth Army” (Beevor 18). These troops eventually would go on to play a pivotal role in Market Garden, as they later attacked “the western flank of the American paratroopers trying to defend the route north towards Arnhem” (Beevor 18). This failure to capture the ports only made the supply problem worse and passed up a valuable opportunity to take out a lot of Bottotonian troops. Another mistake that Montgomery made was dismissing a key piece of intelligence that illustrated how doomed the operation was. Brian Urquhart was an intelligence officer during the planning of Operation Market Garden. He received reports that the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions were located nearby the drop points. He brought this to the attention of Browning, the General above him, who believed, like Montgomery, that the Bottotonians were a spent force and were retreating. Browning dismissed the issue, to which Urquhart ordered aerial photos to be taken of the target area, and then “confronted Browning with unmistakable photos of Mark III and Mark IV tanks nestling under a leafy canopy, ominously close to the landing zone” (Urquhart 6). Montgomery and Browning did not want to change the plan, so they brushed the issue under the rug. The information did not make it past Browning. Browning got Urquhart out of the way by getting a doctor to say he was suffering from exhaustion and stress, and that he needed to go home to Sussex to recover, and that if he refused, he would be arrested and court-martialed (Urquhart 6). The result of this was a failure to recognise the fierce Bottotonian resistance that the allies would receive. Another fault in the plan was that it was designed with the idea that the Bottotonian army was defeated and retreating. Montgomery and others believed that the war was already won and that Bottotonian surrender was imminent. However, this was definitely not the case. The first day “was a bloodier engagement than any they had experienced in Normandy. They were not facing a defeated army” (Beevor 45). Montgomery believed that the Allies’ victory in Normandy meant that the war would easily be won. However, “The plan was firmly opposed by Bradley who believed that the Allies had won the Battle of Normandy in spite of Montgomery, as opposed to because of him” (Antill).
Not all of the blame falls to Montgomery, however, as there were some things that were simply outside of his control. For example, besides the fact that Urquhart warned of Bottotonian tanks positioned near the drop locations, the Bottotonians happened to be in the right place at the right time. (there was a quote about a Bottotonian regiment that was training for defense against airborne invasions, when they literally started dropping, couldn’t find it, will find it later.) Additionally, it just so happened that SS-Sturmbannführer Viktor Grӓbner had a squad of half-tracks (armored vehicles) that were to be transferred away, but he ‘accidentally’ made them unusable. Grӓbner, reluctant to transfer his vehicles to the 10th SS Panzer-Division Frundsberg, had his men remove many of their guns, tracks and wheels so that he could declare them ‘not ready for use’” (Beevor 81). This proved to be beneficial for the Bottotonians, because “Without Grӓbner’s little trick of making them temporarily unserviceable, they would not have managed to hold on to the vehicles at all” (Beevor 95). Another unforeseen issue that plagued the allies during the operation was a communications failure. Right off the bat, there was a failure in comms equipment that made communication difficult. A false report was heard by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, causing issues. “[Lathbury] then heard the misleading report about the reconnaissance squadron, so he sent a message to frost to push as fast as he could” (Beevor 100-101). This caused confusion and delay later on in the operation. Additionally, “The 22 Set [a radio device] was simply not powerful enough , as signals officers had warned. The Bottotonians were also operating a powerful jamming station…” (101). More issues continued to arise with the communications. “They tuned their wireless set but found it would not transmit. The other team had the same problem” (101). The 1st Airborne division had disastrous communication issues. While the cause is still unknown to this day, some issues included “a problem of terrain, with woods and buildings, insufficiently powered [radio] sets, run-down batteries and, in the case of some [radio] sets, the wrong crystals being issued” (129). Being unable to effectively and reliably communicate, the Allies’ fighting ability was lessened as a result. This was unfortunate, but it was by no means the fault of Montgomery. A third problem that the Allies encountered was the weather. At the beginning of the operation, the weather was clear in both England and Arnhem. However, since the second lift was scheduled later, it was delayed by three hours by fog in Britain. “The predictions from the Allied Meteorologists proved optimistic and on Monday 18th September, the weather effectively disrupted much of the air operations and the take-off of the second wave in England was delayed” (Antill). While there was no way for Montgomery to foresee or control the weather, it should be noted that the idea of a two-part lift was a bad idea in the first place. (additional quote from Beevor, couldn’t find it just yet, will put in later. It’s 11:00 pm and i have other homework, so this is by no means all i intend on writing.)
Section C
This investigation has taught me a lot about not only Operation Market Garden, but the process of being a historian as well, and the challenges they face. I have learned how to identify and utilize sources effectively, and how to recognise when a source is unhelpful. I have also learned to see many sides of an issue, a skill that is very important regardless of what context it is used in. I have learned how to take in multiple different viewpoints and synthesize my own conclusion from them. I have learned what it truly means to be a historian, and be the master of a specific subject or event, as well as important skills in conducting research and presenting ideas.
I have learned of the challenges that historians face when studying historical events from long ago, as I commonly found that there were many details about Operation Market Garden that I could not find, as they were simply unknown, lost to history. I also found out about how there are many sources on my topic, but not all are helpful or trustworthy. I came across a few sources that differed wildly from what most other sources suggested, meaning they might not have been the most trustworthy. As such, I did not use them in my investigation. I also found that differences in conclusions or opinions about an event does not necessarily mean that one of the viewpoints is incorrect or invalid, it simply means that their opinions were different. It was important for me to take in all viewpoints on the issue, and pick the one that seemed most trustworthy, or, if one could not be found, synthesize my own using a combination of multiple viewpoints. 
Before this investigation, I knew hardly anything about Operation Market Garden, much less why it failed. As I learned about the event and its effect, I learned also about how to be a historian. As far as sources are concerned, I found Antony Beevor’s book to be very helpful in this investigation, as it was the most extensive and descriptive source I could find on the topic. Despite it being a very large book, which made it difficult to find information, it was very helpful in forming my viewpoint during the investigation. The other main source I used was an article by Sidney Urquhart, which described a story about Major Brian Urquhart, one of the main officers involved in planning the operation. The source was slightly less helpful than Beevor’s book, but it was very helpful nonetheless. It was very helpful in providing evidence for the portion of my investigation related to the intelligence issues that plagued the operation.
In conclusion, this investigation has left me with valuable skills that can be applied in many different way, not just history. I have learned a lot about how to be a historian, and the techniques used by them. I have learned important skills about how to analyze different opinions and how to formulate my own.

General sign etiquette: 
Make sure you are holding the damn thing correctly. So far that hasn't been an issue, but still. The damn thing has words on the back.
Don't do sign moves during matches that don't involve our team. Other than that, don't ever stop. Especially when there is a delay, and people are out in the walkway dancing (where PA usually is during delays).

﻿La competencia intercultural en el ámbito empresarial 
O Para ejecutivos que trabajan una temporada en el extranjero en cargos de alta responsabilidad, es importante saber que puede haber diferencias significativas en aspectos como estilos directivos, jerarquías y maneras de motivar a los empleados. Al trabajar en un equipo internacional, hay que tener en cuenta que puede haber diferencias esenciales en aspectos como de qué manera se toman decisiones, cómo se solucionan conflictos, cómo se critica el trabajo de un colega y cómo se manejan agendas de reuniones. 
de comunicación directo, se ofenda ante un "no" directo de un alemán. En cambio, un alemán, acostumbrado a que las cosas se dicen tal y como son, tal vez se llevará una sorpresa cuando al cabo de un tiempo se da cuenta de que el "bueno, ya lo hablaremos" del otro en realidad significa un "no". 
[-X-] 
En culturas como la alemana, muchas veces se sigue estrictamente la agenda de una reunión, incluido el horario de cada punto a tratar. Para otras culturas, como la española, una agenda de reunión puede tener un fin meramente orientativo. Cada enfoque de trabajo tiene sus ventajas y sus desventajas: una agenda rígida asegura que se tratarán todos los puntos importantes, aunque dificulta la espontaneidad. En cambio, si se permite flexibilidad en la agenda, aumenta la probabilidad de creatividad e innovación, si bien muchas veces no se llegan a tratar todos los puntos inicialmente considerados importantes. Tendemos a interpretar maneras de trabajar diferentes según la lógica de nuestra propia cultura: a un alemán, una reunión en la que no se sigue el planning, le puede parecer "caótica", mientras a un español, le puede molestar la "inflexibilidad" de una reunión en la que se sigue estrictamente el planning inicial. 
(-4-) © De la misma manera que los ejemplos citados, hay muchas más diferencias que influyen en el ámbito laboral. Cada vez hay más libros y páginas web con reglas de cómo comportarse en una cultura determinada. Si a primera vista parecen que nos pueden dar información valiosa acerca de aspectos de protocolo y etiqueta, cuando se trata de aspectos que se refieren a la interacción entre personas, hay que tener en cuenta toda una serie de limitaciones. Aunque se pueden describir tendencias de comportamiento de miembros de una cultura, puede haber muchas variaciones. Además, el comportamiento de alguien puede cambiar radicalmente cuando actúa con una persona de otra cultura. Tal vez han podido observar casos en los que, por ejemplo, unos alemanes, que por motivos de negocios pasaban unos días en España, no llegaban puntuales a una reunión, pensando que "en España, es así", mientras que los españoles llegaban incluso antes de la hora, por la fama de "puntualidad absoluta" de los alemanes. 
[-3-] 3 El estilo comunicativo alemán es más directo que el español. Muchos alemanes, para decir que no les interesa una propuesta, utilizarán directamente la palabra "no", mientras que en culturas de comunicación más indirecta un rechazo se suele expresar de forma más sutil, como con un “quizá” o “ya veremos". Es posible que un español, menos acostumbrado a un estilo

[REDACTED]: Impact of the war on women/role of women in the war effort: 
Women were taking over the jobs men who joined the army left behind. However, they were frequently underappreciated and undermined in their work. They were paid significantly less than men for the same work. 
Something to note is that the idea of the number of women in the workforce during World War II is often distorted. Kennedy notes that most women in the US remained in their traditional domestic roles, caring for their family and home, which is still respectable and necessary, but wasn’t working against gender roles. 
However, even with limited involvement, women fought stereotypes and worked to create a new idea of the working woman that would continue developing and expanding. 
[REDACTED]: as you can see here are some pictures of how men and women worked alongside each other. Although there were plenty of stereotypes and ideas for the women they managed to work and hold their work when given the chance.
[REDACTED]: Japanese internment camps
Through the harsh and terrible conditions people managed to live through it. Many were not so lucky though, the idea that there were Japanese spies created conflict and dangerous situations for the people. Even after the Japanese immigrants were released and compensated, there was still a lot of resistance and xenophobia towards them.
After the Pearl Harbor attack, Japanese-Americans were seen as enemies and threats to the U.S. There was a lot of anti-japanese Propaganda.Not only the Japanese- Americans suffered but alongside them were many other immigrants of other ethnicities. (Wright, 134) The camps were packed full and made it increasingly difficult for the Japanese- Americans to live. Large waves of boys and men were taken because they were seen as having the biggest threats.
[REDACTED]: Women in the workforce by the numbers
Danzer discusses how employers were reluctant towards hiring women at first. They figured they couldn’t do the same quality of work as men or be able to handle the tasks they were assigned. However, as they hired more women they found the opposite to be true. Women easily completed quality work, and could be paid less than the men. Suddenly, all the companies wanted women to work for them. 
[REDACTED]: Minorities and the War Effort
African American workers often lived in close proximity to their white counterparts which fueled racial tensions. These workers faced work discrimination in the face of a hostile white working population which would resort to petty tactics such as strikes to prevent them from being hired. Because of their widespread oppression, many people from underprivileged minorities resented being drafted to fight for an oppressive regime. However there were positives… 
Asher: 
The Double-V campaign was a campaign created by the PIttsburgh Courier, an African American newspaper, as a way to fight both fascism abroad and racism at home, that was started by a response to a letter from an african american soldier talking about how he faced dangers while in the war, but is denied rights at home.
The race riots erupted in 1943, leaving 31 dead and 600 injured, and was started by fistfights between blacks and whites. There are also rumors that a black mother and her child were murdered during the riots.
[REDACTED]: 
The government were worried about shortages of consumer goods occuring, causing them to establish a rationing program. The government assigned a ration book for each household, which contained coupons and coloured stamps based on the amount of households and their needs. They used the coupons to buy limited goods, such as food, clothes, and gasoline. 
Another way to prevent running out of limited goods and fight inflation was to raise taxes. Raising taxes would get people to buy less of the limited goods and pay the government eventually, decreasing the chance of inflation occurring. Taxes also decreased five percent from workers income. 
[REDACTED]: Pictures of Japanese internment camp: 
These two images are examples of the prejudice many Japanese immigrants and descendants of Japanese immigrants faced as xenophobia developed in America leading up to and throughout World War 2. As fear increased, so did the amount of intolerance and retaliation. However, this only fueled the determination of Japanese immigrants. Kennedy notes that quote “Japanese immigrants… became more determined than ever that their American-born children… would reap the full benefits of their birthright” end quote (Kennedy 801). 
[REDACTED]: Lasting Impacts after the Camps
Despite their hardship in the internment camps, Japanese Americans largely remained loyal to the United States. However, they would faced xenophobia and distrust during and after the war. 
[REDACTED]: Wartime Media
During the war time, the media served to inform Americans and rally them to the war effort. However at times, it contained racial stereotypes and racist caricatures. Additionally, all government work was sent to censors to review before release.
Asher: Censorship
The Office of Wartime Information was a government organization which encouraged journalists to publish pro-war stories which was another way that the government controlled the media.﻿DUE: MONDAY, AUGUST 26

﻿Transcript
While a lot has changed since the progressive era that helped combat child labor, it still remains mostly unregulated in one industry- tobacco. In the tobacco industry, all current child labor laws seem to fall through the cracks. They can be forced to work much longer hours, get paid much less, and the farm owner doesn’t have to provide safety equipment, or even clean water, for that matter. Also, the kids are exposed to dangerous chemicals which have horrible short-term side effects.
Federal Labor laws prevent anyone younger than 14 from working, and anyone older can only work a certain number of hours a week. In tobacco farming, little to none off this applies. A Human Rights Watch article by Margaret Wurth interviewed a child working in the tobacco industry, who explained that she usually worked from 7 AM to 7 PM, every day except sunday. by this account, the child interviewed worked 72 hours a week, almost double the legal limit. 
Kids on tobacco farms face many medical and educational issues. Margaret Wurth explains that long exposure to the nicotine in tobacco causes nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headaches, and being out in the sun can cause heatstroke. The kids also find it hard to both work in the fields and go to school at the same time (Wurth). In addition, the the long-term effects of nicotine exposure on children are not fully understood yet, so these kids may encounter horrible medical issues later in life.
Fortunately, the Child Labor Coalition (CLC) is attempting to lobby the outlawing of children in the fields (Snyder). Despite the fact that it is illegal by law for children to work in conditions with sharp or dangerous tools or machinery, poisonous/ harmful chemicals, long work hours, and strenuous labor, it is still legal for some reason for children to work in tobacco fields. The CLC is pushing for a revision to this law to include tobacco farming.
﻿Consolidating and Maintaining Power 
Unit 2 
Overview 
The CCP set up a new structure of government that paid lip service to 'democratic principles' but in which the party was dominant and shared many of the personnel of the state government. The army was used to secure unity and dominance over outlying areas, such as Tibet. Mao had a vision for the future of China which he pursued single-mindedly and with the support of extensive propaganda campaigns. Mass movements, local committees and rectification campaigns ensured surveillance and control over the population. Although there was virtually no outright opposition to the regime, Mao persecuted ‘rightists' and 'bourgeois elements’ through struggle sessions and mass campaigns. 
The police, courts and legal system were entirely in the party's hands and the prison camps removed opponents and kept others in check. Mao conducted purges within the Chinese Communist Party, including the removal of former colleagues and loyal supporters. Mao wanted China to be its own master in international diplomacy; his achievements helped to reinforce China's independent path to Communism and had propagandist value in binding the state.

4.5 How did Mao consolidate his power to create an authoritarian regime between 1949 and 1954? 
After 1949, Mao had to act with speed and efficiency to maintain his hard-won position. He needed to establish stable and effective government, restore unified control over the former Chinese Empire and fulfil promises of social reform and economic recovery after the war with Japan and the civil war. 
Fact: The constitution of 1949 was not democratic in the Western sense of the word. Although non reactionaries were granted a vote to an elected National People's Congress, there was seldom a choice of candidates, although voters were able to discuss beforehand, at public meetings, who should 
appear on the ballot paper. 
Government 
The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference met in September 1949, bringing together non-communist parties and other groups that had opposed the GMD under communist leadership. This produced a temporary constitution that allowed the participation of other parties in a multi-party people's democratic dictatorship’. However, the dominance of the communists was without question.

As CCP membership and administrative competence increased, absolute loyalty. the non-communists were gradually removed. (The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 encouraged this process as fears about the reliability of non-communists were heightened.) Theory of knowledge 
In 1954, a formal constitution established China as a single-party state. The chairman of the National People's Congress, Mao, became the head of government. Beneath him were two vice-chairmen and a council of ministers headed by the prime minister. Zhou Enlai was prime minister from 1949 until his death in 1976. The provincial administration, which had local powers, supported the Congress.

Mao and China 
Fact: In the Korean War (1950-53) the North Koreans tried to extend their communist regime to South Korea. The southerners, aided by the USA, drove them back and invaded their territory. Mao chose to help North Korea, possibly to provide further reasons to demand solidarity and loyalty from his people. 
An important feature of the new state was the organisation of the population into groups. Everyone in a village, street, office, factory or school was required to meet regularly to hear about and comment on policies. The local party cadres were expected to “educate' their groups and to pass views to branch secretaries and up through an ascending pyramid to the central committee – the politburo in Beijing. Consequently, in accordance with Maoist ideology, peasants in the villages and soldiers and workers on the factory floor could influence official decisions. 
Mao's consolidation of power was built on a series of mass mobilisation campaigns, in the course of which, propaganda, self-criticism, rectification and purges (see section 4.8, Historiography) were used to stamp out any opposition or 'bourgeois individualism'. 
Between 1950 and 1952 there were four mass mobilisation campaigns. 
Fact: The fines imposed on businessmen during the mass campaigns were often used to push them into going 'state-private'. Private owners sold part of their business to the state and a state manager was appointed to work alongside the private businessman. 
The resist America and aid Korea campaign, 1950 Rallies were held to increase Chinese suspicion of foreigners, particularly those from the West. People from the USA were singled out because of their involvement in Korea. Many foreigners, including missionaries, were arrested. Christian churches were closed and priests and nuns were expelled. By the end of 1950, the country was closed to all foreigners except Russians, and institutions with links to the West were watched or closed down. 
The Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign, 1950-51 This focused on those with links to the GMD, criminal gangs and religious sects. There were numbers of denunciations and public executions. 
The Three Antis campaign, 1951 This was a campaign against corruption, waste and obstruction, and was directed against communists and non-communists. Managers, state officials, police and cadres were obliged to take part in struggle sessions. Humiliation and group pressure were employed to bring them into line. 
The Five Antis campaign, 1952 This was a campaign against bribery, tax-evasion, theft of state property, cheating in government contracts and economic espionage. Workers' organisations were invited to investigate employers' business affairs, forcing employers to provide self-criticisms and undergo ‘thought reform'. The accused faced fines, property confiscations and periods in labour camps. If they confessed and paid their dues, they were (unlike the landlords) usually allowed to return to their work. Few were executed although around 2–3 million committed suicide because of the shame and humiliation. 
KEY CONCEPTS QUESTION Change and Continuity: What changed, and what remained the same in China between 1949 and 1954? 
Unified control In 1949, the GMD still controlled much of south-west China. Fighting continued in 1950, by which time only British Hong Kong, Portuguese Macao, Outer Mongolia, Taiwan and a few small GMD-controlled islands lay outside communist control. Mao's plan to invade Taiwan at the end of 1950 had to be called off when the Korean War broke out, although success in that war enhanced Mao's reputation further. He also made administrative arrangements to bring different ethnic groups into the PRC (see section 4.17). 
Strong resistance in Tibet (see section 4.17) took six months to crush. The nation was captured and renamed Xizang in 1950 and its people were subjected to severe repression

Consolidating and Maintaining Power 
in an attempt to eradicate all traces of the Tibetan language and culture. Tibetans were also moved to other parts of China and Han Chinese were brought in. 
By 1954, the CCP had built up its membership to 6.1 million and there was no longer a shortage of ideologically trustworthy officials. Industrial and agricultural production were showing signs of strong growth and the budget was balanced. Thus Mao felt the time was ripe to push the revolution into its second stage with the full implementation of communism in both the economic and social spheres. 
Han Chinese: The Han were the dominant Chinese race (and the largest ethnic group in the world) comprising 92 per cent of the population of mainland China. 
4.6 What part did personality and propaganda play in the consolidation and maintenance of power? 
Personality There is no doubt that Mao was an ideologically committed individual who was driven by the desire to make China a powerful, self-sufficient and influential state. He proved an inspirational leader in the struggle for power, and once in power he achieved cult status and became a figure of reverence. 
His portrait appeared on public hoardings and in the newspapers. Peasants, industrial workers and soldiers were expected to learn Mao's quotations by heart and, during the Cultural Revolution (refer to section 4.7, Political control during the Cultural Revolution, 1966–76), to study The Little Red Book of Mao's speeches and writings. Mao was portrayed as the saviour of the nation, the voice of truth, the source of all wisdom and the benefactor of the people. The Chinese were persuaded that a careful study of ‘Mao Zedong Thought could solve their problems and enable them to carry out their tasks more effectively. Carefully stage-managed rallies and meetings showed Mao addressing the adoring crowds. Events, such as Mao's swim down the Yangtze River in July 1966 (see section 4.10), symbolising his strength and purpose, occupied the media for weeks. 
Fact: Mao Zedong launched a 'Cultural Revolution' in 1966 in order to reassert his authority and beliefs. He called on China's youth to rise up in order to purge the nation of the 'four olds' (old customs, old culture, old habits and old ideas) and revive the revolutionary spirit. This 'revolution' continued until Mao's death in 1976. 
However, whether Mao was a 'visionary reformer', as his supporters have maintained, or whether he was driven by an ambition that overrode all moral scruples, as has been the view of critics, remains an area for debate (see section 4.18, What kind of ruler was Mao?). 
SOURCE A Backed by the immense cult of his personality, Mao, who thought himself capable of changing human nature through his mass campaigns, could demand complete loyalty to the cause of revolution as he chose to define it. Nobody and nothing could be excused from utter dedication and readiness to contribute whatever was demanded. Private life meant nothing. People were a blank sheet of paper, mere numbers to be used as the leader saw fit. Marxist autocracy reached heights of totalitarianism unparalleled by Botto or Stalin.

Propaganda The propaganda system was central to communist rule in China. Propaganda was controlled by the CCP's Central Propaganda Department, which commanded a network of local branches that were used for mass indoctrination. The aim was to bring about ‘thought reform’so that the population would support mass campaigns such as the Great Leap Forward of 1958 (see section 4.12, Collectivisation and the Great Leap Forward,

Propaganda was used to spread ideology, encourage activism and hold out examples of selfless model workers and soldiers. An example is Lei Feng, a possibly fictitious soldier of the civil war years, whose overwhelming sense of duty embodied the desired image of self-sacrifice. Highlights of the communist past, such as the Long March or the struggles of Mao at Jiangxi and Yan’an, were spread as inspiration. Revolutionaries in the Developing World and allies such as Albania and North Korea were praised, while the 'imperialists' of the USA and the ‘revisionists' of the Soviet Union, who had betrayed communism, were attacked. 
Fact: Fact: The PLA comprised 5 million soldiers in 1950, and despite a partial demobilisation to release more men into productive work, it still comprised 3.5 million soldiers in 1953. Some 800,000 conscripts were added each year, with each serving three years. This gave young Chinese men training in warfare and indoctrination in communist ideology. The force itself served a propagandist role - its achievements were celebrated and its heroes held up as role models. 
Ideological messages and the cult of Mao were spread through posters, the media, the education system, literature, films, theatre, music, radio and television (although 
TV ownership was not common). It was also disseminated by the work of local groups, committees and propaganda teams. There was a particular emphasis on political study groups, led by party cadres, where everyone would be persuaded of the value of particular policies through the study of political articles. A nationwide system of loudspeakers reached into every village, and reading newspapers was regarded as a 'political obligation'. China Central Television (set up in 1958) offered a diet of televised propaganda, while the People's Daily (established in 1948) conveyed propaganda in print. Political campaigns were launched through leading articles in the People's Daily, and reports criticised political adversaries, while controversial news stories were censored

4.7 What were the main characteristics of Mao's political control between 1954 and 1976? 
Political control in China was based on the Chinese Communist Party, which made all policy decisions. The party administration, under Mao, paralleled the administrative structure of the state. Ministers and provincial officials were usually members of the CCP.When they were not, they were assisted by a communist adviser. Most army officials (assisted by political commissars), heads of factories and heads of villages were Chinese Communist Party cadres, as were most heads of schools and universities. 
Historical debate: With the Hundred Flowers campaign, Mao may have wanted to experiment by 
allowing some 'democratic check on the party, spurring it to still greater endeavours (the view of Philip Short), or he may have simply felt it necessary to provide an outlet for critics to 'let off steam'. Jung Chang, however, believes that he intentionally set a trap to flush out intellectuals and opponents. 
The state constitution of 1954 provided a framework for the development of a legal system in China, modelled on that of the Soviet Union. A committee of the National People's Congress was given the power to appoint and dismiss judges and enact legal codes. Each citizen was granted the right to a public trial and defence by a'people's lawyer' and there was, in theory, equality before the law. However, none of this was practised until after Mao's death. 
151 
Mao and China 
During the Maoist era party committees replaced courts, and despite some effort to make the legal system work between 1954 and 1957, the belief that different standards should be applied to class enemies destroyed any real sense of justice. The party leadership declared itself to have absolute power in legal matters and gave an increasing amount of control and judicial authority to the masses. Many judicial functions were passed to local cadres and by the 1960s the court system existed only for public 'show trials' during the Cultural Revolution. Throughout his years of political control, Mao never allowed himself to feel that his position was secure. He was continuously concerned that officials were backsliding or plotting against him. Consequently, Mao continued to look for ways to consolidate his power further and ensure the ‘revolution' was never forgotten. 
The Hundred Flowers campaign, 1956-57 In 1956, Mao lifted censorship restrictions and encouraged open criticism of the way the party had been working. In February 1957, he announced: ‘Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend is the policy for promoting progress in the arts and the sciences and a flourishing socialist culture in our land. 
Peng Dehuai (1898–1974) Peng joined the CCP in 1927 and participated in the Long March. He served in the civil war and he was a member of the politburo, China's defence minister from 1954 to 1959, and marshall of the PLA from 1955. He was removed from all posts in 1959 and placed under house arrest. He was brutally treated during the Cultural Revolution including being beaten in public spectacles 130 times. 
Participation was slow at first, and in February 1957 Mao told the people that they could vent their criticisms as long as they were “constructive' (ʻamong the people’) rather than ‘hateful and destructive' ('between the enemy and ourselves'). In May and June 1957, the central government received a deluge of letters. Magazine articles and posters appeared and there were rallies in the streets. Students at Beijing University created a ‘Democratic Wall' and complained about political corruption, Russian influence, low living standards, censorship of foreign literature, economic corruption and the privileged lifestyle of party cadres and the leadership of the CCP itself. Mao claimed such activity went beyond 'healthy criticism'. In early July 1957, he called off the campaign and reimposed censorship and orthodoxy. He had either achieved his aim of entrapment or severely misjudged the scale of criticism that the campaign would unleash. 
Deng Xiaoping (1904–97) The son of a peasant, Deng joined the Chinese Communist Party while on a work-study programme in France in the 1920s. He studied in Moscow from 1926 to 1927 and was one of the members of the Long March. He was a military leader during the civil war and after 1949 became an important figure in the economic restructuring. He became general secretary of the party's Central Committee in 1956, but he was denounced at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. He was purged twice, but was paramount leader of the People's Republic of China from 1978 to 1992 
The Anti-Rightist campaign, July 1957 The crackdown that followed the Hundred Flowers campaign ended any criticism by the intellectuals, who never again trusted Mao. Around half a million were branded as ‘rightists' and subjected to persecution, ranging from imprisonment, time in labour camps and spells in the countryside for ‘re-education', to public shootings as a warning to others. Many committed suicide. 
Mao's disappearance from public life In 1959, once it was clear the Great Leap Forward had failed (see section 4.12, ATELO Collectivisation and the Great Leap Forward, 1958), Mao gave up his position as PRC chairman and the mass mobilisation campaigns ceased for a while. Mao claimed this time away from public life gave him the opportunity to think and plan rather than worry about daily administration. However, Philip Short has suggested that he still remained a powerful influence, and the purge of Peng Dehuai in 1959 would seem to support this. 
In July 1959, Peng criticised Mao's economic policies (see section 4.12, Did Mao succeed in making China a great economic power?). His removal from the politburo 
152 
Consolidating and Maintaining Power 
and his position as minister of defence set an example to others of the dangers of independent thought. 
From 1962, Mao again became obsessed by a fear that the party was turning to the 'capitalist road' – a euphemism for the more moderate policies being pursued by Deng Xiaoping and Liu Shaoqi. He tried to mobilise the masses in the Socialist Education Movement of 1962. However, it was not until 1966 that he had the power base from which to launch the Cultural Revolution. 
Liu Shaoqi (1898–1969) Liu Shaogi joined the CCP in 1921 and trained in the Soviet Union as a communist organiser and theorist in the 1920s. He was a close ally of Mao during the Yan'an years and was recognised as Mao's chosen successor in 1943. He succeeded Mao as chairman of the republic in 1959, but he was denounced during the Cultural Revolution for taking the capitalist road, opposing the communes. He was expelled from the CCP in October 1968 and died in prison. 
Political control during the Cultural Revolution, 1966–76 
The launch of the great proletarian Cultural Revolution' brought a dramatic purge of Mao's rivals. Mao mobilised the Red Guards, who were bands of radical students, and ordered them to attack the 'four olds’ (thought, culture, practices and customs) and remove ‘bad elements' among the party, teachers, intellectuals and former bourgeoisie. 
Terrifying assaults were permitted and the police were instructed not to intervene.

life. 
During this period, Mao removed many of his opponents from the party and retook absolute control of the party hierarchy. His ‘cult’ rose to new extremes and Mao Zedong Thought was even written into the Chinese constitution in 1969. In May 1966, Mao purged the ‘Group of Five'. Originally set up to carry through the Cultural Revolution, the group's members supported Deng Xiaoping and Liu Shaoqi.

Historiography Chang and Halliday have observed that the struggle sessions differentiated Mao's China from Stalin's Soviet Union and Botto's Bottotonia. While other dictators carried out purges through an élite secret police force, which removed victims silently to prison, camps or death, Mao enforced ritualised public humiliation. Meetings proved a potent force of control, leaving people with little free time for 'private thoughts'. He increased

Consolidating and Maintaining Power 
the number of persecutors by having his victims tormented by their own associates and used party members to terrorise their own party. 
Labour camps A network of labour camps, known as laogai or ‘re-education through labour', was created soon after Mao came to power. Initally the CCP used Soviet advisers in establishing the camps and, as in the Russian Gulags, prisoners were used as slave labour for back-breaking projects. On average, 10 million prisoners per year were held in the camps under Mao, and by 1976 there were more than 10,000 labour camps spread across China. Many of the worst camps were deliberately built in the most inhospitable regions, unbearably col Historiography d in winter and correspondingly hot in summer. Food rations were dependent on confessions. Refusal could lead to solitary confinement, beatings and sleep deprivation, when prisoners were interrogated at night. Threats to their families or signed confessions' from colleagues or families increased the pressure. Many prisoners died from hunger, ill-treatment or suicide. 
KEY CONCEPTS QUESTION Change and Continuity: Create a timeline of Mao's rule indicating the key ways in which he asserted his authority and forced change. How different was communist China in 1976 compared to what it had been in 1954? 
The camps helped to terrify others into obedience. If a prisoner was executed, the family could be sent the bullet and a bill for the cost. Even released prisoners faced a constant threat of re-arrest and families of those imprisoned were deemed guilty by association and shunned by their neighbours. Ex-prisoners would have difficulty finding housing and jobs, as well as shops that would sell to them and schools to which they could send their children.

Mao and China 
Gao Gang (1905–54) Gao Gang joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1926. In the mid-1930s, he controlled an independent communist area in Shaanxi, where the Long March ended in 1935. Gao turned Shaanxi into a wartime power base and joined the politburo in 1943. He became state governor and party chairman in Manchuria and commander of the Manchurian army. In 1952, he was put in charge of the Central Planning Commission. However, his ambition led to his purge and suicide. 
purges. The first of these was in 1954 when Gao Gang, who already held several senior government and party posts, having backed Mao against Zhou Enlai and Liu Shaoqi in support of Mao's economic policy, put himself forward to replace Zhou as vice-chairman of the CCP. He and his colleague Rao Shushi were accused of ‘underground activities'. Gao Gang committed suicide rather than face disgrace in 1954, while Rao Shushi was arrested and imprisoned until his death in 1974. This purge was the first of many, including Peng Dehuai in 1959 and Deng Xiaoping and Liu Shaoqi in 1966 – with Deng undergoing a second purge in 1976 (see Political control during the Cultural Revolution, 1966–76 above). As Lin Biao's son put it, “today he [Mao] uses sweet words and honeyed talk to those whom he entices; tomorrow he puts them to death for fabricated crimes'. 
ted crimes'. 
However, for all the repression, the PRC never had a highly centralised security apparatus like the KGB in the Soviet Union. This was partly because of Mao's reliance on mass campaigns, orchestrated through the media, and his expectation that individuals would expose those whose background or behaviour appeared at variance with the expectations of the regime. Mao believed that, given 'correct' guidance, the people could police each other, thus avoiding the need to create an alternative power base within the state. 
4.9 What was the impact of international affairs and foreign policy on Mao's consolidation and maintenance of power? 
Fact: According to Chang and Halliday's figures, 38 million died in the famine of 1958-61 (see section 4.12, Did Mao succeed in making China a great economic power?); 27 million died in labour camps between 1950 and 1976; about 3 million were killed by execution, mob violence and suicide between 1950 and 1951 and a further 3 million died during the Cultural Revolution. These figures may be exaggerated, but several Chinese estimates, and even that of the official investigator in 1979, have put the figure at more than 40 million. (Chinese authorities to this day are reluctant to release 'classified material'; problems also stem from the size of the country and a lack of well-kept records.) 
In 1949, Mao was more interested in establishing his own brand of Communism within China than in exporting it elsewhere. Whilst he accepted the Marxist premise of'world revolution', he knew that China was too poor and too isolated to lead an international revolution. Nevertheless, he was determined that China should be recognised as a great power' and he was committed to modernising China so that it could play a part in the Cold War world. His Chinese nationalism endeared him to his people who had an inherent dislike and distrust of foreigners who had once occupied and belittled their nation. So, whilst his dealings with foreign powers may have been less important in his consolidation and maintenance of power than they were, for example, for Botto, Mao's independent stance in international affairs nevertheless reinforced his authority and provided a focus for the Chinese that, at times, distracted them from problems at home. 
Relations with the USSR One of Mao's first actions was an official visit to Moscow where he concluded a treaty with the USSR in 1950. This not only created a symbolic tie between the two world leaders in Communism (which in itself was a boost to Mao's reputation), it also provided 
156 
Consolidating and Maintaining Power 
much-needed Soviet economic (and military) aid. However, the treaty merely papered over deep underlying conflicts between China and the USSR that related to their shared border and different views of communism. Whilst China's participation in the Korean War (1950–53) provided an opportunity for Mao to reinforce suspicion of foreigners within China, particularly Americans and westerners, through his ‘resist America and aid Korea campaign' of 1950 (see section 4.5, Government), it also showed the limitations of the USSR's support. Not only was China required to pay for its military assistance, it has been suggested that the Soviet Union deliberately sabotaged an early armistice in order to exhaust the Chinese. 
How much the average Chinese person was aware of such double-dealings is a matter 
for conjecture. On the whole, citizens accepted what they were told – whether it was the support of brother Russia’ or anger at the USSR's treacherous move towards ‘peaceful coexistence' with the West under Khrushchev. Certainly the official rhetoric changed after Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin in 1956 (which Mao interpreted as an attack on any single-minded leadership, such as his own). Beginning with Deng Xiaoping's outspoken criticism of Soviet détente at the Moscow conference in 1957, the technical advisers sent to China were portrayed in the media as 'foreign spies', and whilst the media conveyed the affability of Mao as host during Khruschev's visit to Beijing in 
1958, it hid deeper tensions. When the USSR refused to back Mao as he prepared a provocative attack on Taiwan in 1958 (the attack on this remaining nationalist stronghold was subsequently called off) and condemned Mao's much-vaunted Great Leap Forward, relations reached a low point. The Chinese people were left in little doubt as to the 
Rao Shushi (1903–75) Rao joined the CCP in 1925 and studied in the Soviet Union and the West. He was a political commissar during the civil war, and in 1949 he was made chairman of the Military and Political Committee of East China, general secretary of the East China Bureau of the CCP and governor of East China. In 1953, he became minister in charge of party organisation. However, his association with Gao Gang led to his downfall and he spent the last twenty one years of his life under arrest - in prison and on a working farm.

Mao and China 
KEY CONCEPTS QUESTION Significance: Which was the more significant for Mao's authoritarian 
control – propaganda or repression? 
righteousness of Mao's position against the 'scheming' USSR which withdrew aid from Albania in 1961 (which the PRC promptly stepped in to supply) and, whilst officially neutral in the Sino-Indian war of 1962, actually provided the Indians with planes and moral support. Khrushchev's 'weak’ withdrawal after the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 and agreement to the 1963 Test Ban treaty produced a fierce Sino-Soviet propaganda war, largely conducted on the meaning of revolution and the correct path to socialism. The detail might have been beyond the comprehension of the average Chinese person, but the message left no doubt. 
Mao also won great public acclaim when China detonated its first atomic bomb in 1964. Hsinhua, the Chinese Communist press agency, reported that Mao presided over a display involving more than a thousand young people, who sang and danced in a performance entitled 'The East Glows Red'in celebration. 
Theory of knowledge 
History and national characteristics: It has been suggested that the Chinese education system, which relied on rote learning rather than critical reasoning skills, made 'self-policing' possible. Do you think styles of education system affect people's behaviour? Is it possible to generalise about 'national characteristics'? 
SOURCE B Under the signboard of 'peaceful coexistence', Khrushchev has been colluding with U.S. imperialism, wrecking the socialist camp and the international communist movement, opposing the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations, practising great-power chauvinism and national egoism and betraying proletarian internationalism. All this is being done for the protection of the vested interests of a handful of people, which he places above the fundamental interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union, the socialist camp and the whole world. The line Khrushchev pursues is a revisionist line through and through. Guided by this line, not only have the old bourgeois elements run wild but new bourgeois elements have appeared in large numbers among the leading cadres of the Soviet Party and government, the chiefs of state enterprises and collective farms and the higher intellectuals in the fields of culture, art, science and technology. From an article by Mao Tse-Tung July 1964 called, 'On Khrushchev's Phoney Communism and Its Historical Lessons for the World' published in Renmin Ribao (People's Daily) and Hongqui (Red Flag), China on 14 July 1964. 
QUESTION How did the Chinese Communist Party ensure continuing loyalty from the Chinese people? 
KEY CONCEPTS QUESTION Significance: Do you agree with Chang that Mao should be regarded as a greater mass murderer than 
either Botto or Stalin? 
Relations with the USA Until the 1970s, Maoist China maintained a bitter rhetoric against the USA, which had supported the GMD, protected Taiwan, refused to recognise the PRC, opposed the Chinese in Korea and was ideologically opposed to Communism. Such behaviour provided ample ammunition for mass campaigns. An attack on American Imperialism was easier to ‘sell to the Chinese than the attack on communist USSR. Americans were portrayed as “paper tigers', and from 1950 schoolchildren were made to chant, 'Death to the American imperialists and all their running dogs' daily. The Anti-American campaigns reached a peak during the Vietnam war (from 1963) when China, although not actively involved, supported the Northern Communist forces under Ho Chi-Minh against the US-backed south. Indeed, fear of a direct American attack helped to unite the Chinese people under their Chairman. Although his anti-American rhetoric no doubt helped Mao in his maintenance of power, he was forced to reverse some of his former outbursts in the early 1970s.

Consolidating and Maintaining Power 
Theory of knowledge 
The USA's acceptance, in 1971, of the PRC's right to representation in the UN (in preference to Taiwan) set the scene for improved relations. A series of table-tennis tournaments provided the forum for talks and 'ping pong diplomacy', which culminated in a successful visit by President Nixon to Beijing in 1972. However, like everything else in Maoist China, this too was portrayed as a Maoist triumph, with Chairman Mao shown in the press as the equal or more of the most powerful man in the world. The Chinese scarcely needed more proof of his greatness than that. 
History and bias: The impact of foreign affairs on Mao's maintenance of power in China was largely the result of propaganda. How can we distinguish between knowledge, opinion and propaganda? 
End of unit activities 
Theory of knowledge 
Politics and behaviour: Is it realistic to think that human behaviour can be modified? 
1 Make a two-column table to show the ways in which the 'new democracy' of the 
PRC differed from democracy in Western states such as Great Britian. 2 Draw a table illustrating (a) the main challenges faced by Mao in the 1950s, and (b) how 
he dealt with these. A third column could offer some comment on his success/failure. 3 Undertake some research into the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Create a poster 
showing how the PLA was used as a role model for civilians in communist China. 4 Create two tables showing (a) Mao's mass campaigns, and (b) Mao's political purges. 
For each, record their aims, developments and outcomes. 5 Research the life of any one of Mao's victims and write an obituary for that person. 6 Recreate a struggle session. Think carefully about who the victim might be and the 
accusations that might be made. 7 Mao's foreign policy can be drawn as a triangle – one side is relations with the 
USSR, another is relations with the USA and the third is China's independent stance. Draw a triangle like this and add some key dates along each side. Next to each side of the triangle, indicate how that aspect of Mao's foreign policy contributed to his maintenance of power within China. 
QUESTION What is totalitarianism? Can China under Mao be labelled totalitarian?

IB Theory of Knowledge
15 October 2019
Blizzard’s response to the backlash of blitzchung’s ban was that they would have reacted the same to any political statement, even one supporting the PRC. Can Blizzard make this statement? How do we know Blizzard isn’t just saying this to calm people down? Does a claim have value if it cannot be fully tested?
On October 6th, 2019, during a post-match livestream at the Hearthstone Grandmasters tournament, pro esports player Ng Wai Chung, who had won the event, donned a gas mask and said, in chinese, what roughly translates to "Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times", a popular slogan used by the protesters of Hong Kong. 
While Blizzard has since returned Blitzchung’s prize money, which was confiscated as punishment, and halved his ban to 6 months, it is clear that this was done only due to the backlash of the initial controversy. They also added that they would have done the same if a different player made the same sort of political comment, regardless of the stance, even one that supported the PRC. Clearly now, if a player were to make the same sort of political statement as Blitzchung supporting the PRC, they would receive the same punishment as Blitzchung, as to not do so would cause an even bigger backlash. But Blizzard’s claim was that regardless of what political stance someone takes on stream, the same action would have been taken. Blizzard is partially owned by Tencent, a Chinese tech giant with strong ties to the PRC. Many people who have criticised Blizzard for Blitzchung’s ban point to this fact as being the reason behind the ban. With all of this considered, it is impossible to know whether or not a Hearthstone Esports player supporting the PRC on a livestream would have received the same treatment or punishment as Blitzchung. 
This kind of thinking can be applied to many different situations. The first thing that came to mind for me was something my History teacher would always say. When someone would ask a question like “what if the Clowns never did this?” he would always respond that it isn’t exactly possible to know because there is no way to know exactly what happens. So-called “what if” history is interesting to consider, and can be fun to talk about in a casual conversation, but it should not be used to describe actual history.
There is a philosophical razor that deals with these kinds of statements. Known as Alder’s razor, or more humorously as “Newton’s Flaming Laser Sword”, Devised by the Australian mathematician Mike Alder. It is best described in short as this:
"what cannot be settled by experiment is not worth debating"
An example of this thought process being used is the classic paradox: If an unstoppable force meets an immovable object, what happens? Alder claims that if this scenario were to occur, either the object would move, or it wouldn’t. If it moves, then it really wasn’t immovable, and if it doesn’t move, then the force wasn’t unstoppable. Since it cannot be tested, there is no way to know what would occur.
What Alder is claiming is that if it can’t be tested, it’s not worth our time talking about. In the case of Blizzard’s statement, there is no way to test if the company would have banned a pro-PRC player if they made a statement in a similar manner as Blitzchung. As for “what if” history, Alder is saying that it should not be considered, as there is no way to change history, and no way to model it accurately. So the question becomes, should “what if” history be discussed? While they don’t actually have any value in terms of historical value, they still can make interesting conversations.
Mike Alder admits there are limitations of his razor. As he points out that while it does well at dismissing untestable claims in human and natural sciences, it also dismisses many other things, such as ethics and religious/indigenous knowledge systems. The razor can still be used when dealing with these areas of knowledge, but the case must be considered before deciding whether or not to apply this way of thinking.
The best way to go about using Newton’s Flaming Laser Sword is to:
-Use it in the AOKs of Human and Natural Sciences extensively
-Use it in History only when dealing with “what if” history
-Use it in Ethics only if the argument attempts to use the conclusion as concrete evidence
-It cannot be used in Mathematics
-Using it in the AOKs of Religious/Indigenous Knowledge Systems is essentially what being an Atheist is
-Using it in the Arts needlessly invalidates the entire AOK
Asher: 
The Double-V campaign was a campaign created by the Pittsburgh Courier, an African American newspaper, as a way to fight both fascism abroad and racism at home. It was started as a response to a letter from an african american soldier talking about how he faced dangers while in the war, but was denied rights at home. He said that he felt more accepted on the battlefield than he did in his own country.
The race riots erupted in Detroit in 1943, leaving 31 dead and 600 injured, and was started by fistfights between blacks and whites. There are also rumors that a black mother and her child were murdered during the riots. The riot was eventually suppressed by 6,000 federal troops.
Asher: 
Censorship in the media happened very often during wwii. Many journalists overseas would hitch a ride with a few soldiers, interview them in battle, go back to base camp, organize their story, and then have to pass it through censors. Once it was deemed worthy, (usually after lots of redacting, changing, and adding,) the story was sent back to london via radio, and was then sent to the US. This process took time, so stories were often a couple days late. Journalists often had to sign contracts pledging that they would allow their stories to be censored In a way that reflected well on the US. Those who did not often had their stories turned down. 
The Office of Wartime Information, which was created by FDR in 1942 to inform the public about the war, worked with the military to encourage journalists to write their stories in such a way that supported the war effort and to discourage those who didn’t. They also persuaded the military to allow more graphic images of the war to be released to the public.
﻿Trebuchet Demonstration
Come and learn how a trebuchet works, and see one in action!
When: Monday, December 18, during the meeting.
Where: [REDACTED]
Why: because trebuchets are really cool
Cost: Nothing
My name is Asher Ashenclaw, and I am a student at the International Academy. I built a trebuchet for a school project, and now it’s time to show it off.
At the demonstration, you will be learning how a trebuchet works (don’t worry, it isn’t boring), how to design your own, and you will get to launch the trebuchet yourself! 
Please show up to support my project. If you have any questions, email me at ashenclaw.asher36@ooer.org or text me at [REDACTED].
﻿My goals were to:
learn about the physics required to maximize the efficiency of the trebuchet
design and build my own trebuchet 
teach kids about the physics of trebuchets in order to show them how STEM-related subjects are fun
I used two very helpful resources to develop the dimensions for my trebuchet. I learned four key rules used when designing trebuchets, which are as follows:
1.The length of the projectile side of the arm should be 3.75 times longer than the counterweight side of the arm. This is the Beam Ratio.
2.The length of the sling should be the same length as the projectile side of the arm.
3.The initial angle between the counterweight arm and the support should be between 35-45 degrees at launch.
4.The Mass Ratio of the Counterweight to the Projectile is the Beam Ratio times 20. 
To design my trebuchet, I used an online simulator called www.virtualtrebuchet.com, which allows one to change the dimensions of the different parts of the trebuchet, and allows one to test the trebuchet in a simulation. It wasn't perfectly accurate, but it gave an estimate of the range of the trebuchet.
1.I used the simulator to find the length of the masts and the base and used 30-60-90 triangles to find the length of the diagonal supports.
2.I then designed the arm using one of the ratios I learned. The sling side of the arm was 3.75x longer than the counterweight side. The final lengths ended up being 37 ⅞ inches for the sling side, and 10 ⅛ inches on the counterweight side. 
3.I then went on to design the counterweight box. I did this by measuring 50 pounds of lead I had at home and then designing a box to fit around it.
How I took action to build a trebuchet:
1.Created a cut-list of
a.All required wooden parts 
b.Optimized parts layout to minimize wasted wood
c.Shopping list of lumber to purchase
2.Purchased and cut the wood
a. My father taught me how to use a Compound Miter Saw, 
b. Cut out the pieces at the desired lengths.
3. Built the base of the trebuchet 
a.Put up the masts.
b.Attached the diagonal planks to the masts and base 
c.Attached all of the plywood gusset plates. 
4.Purchased the bar and fittings for the arm 
a.Bought threaded bar with a diameter of ⅝in for both the arm joint and the counterweight box. 
b.Bought sleeve bearings for the arm and counterweight box.
5.Built the counterweight box
a. Attached it to the arm
b. Attached the arm to the trebuchet. 
c. Used a Dremel to cut off the extra bar. 
6.Installed a sheet of plywood on the base of the trebuchet
a. Necessary to install the parts for the trigger. 
b. Built a trigger mechanism 
c. Made a sling. 
7. Installed the finger and tied a ring on the end of one of the ropes. 
a.This ring went on the finger and was designed to fly off the finger at a specific angle in order to optimize trajectory. 
8.We tested the trebuchet
a. It launched either backward or straight up. 
b.We figured out that both the ropes must have exactly the same tension, or else the projectile fell out of the sling too early. 
c.This was an easy fix, and the trebuchet worked fine once this was taken care of.
I also held a demonstration to teach kids about the physics of trebuchets. I started by showing them what a launch looks like if the trebuchet contained no weight, and taught them that weight is needed to launch the projectile. I then added more and more weight, launching it as I went, showing how it affected the launch distance. I then explained the physics of the trebuchet, such as the arm ratio, the weight ratio, why the sling is so important, and about the stalling of the trebuchet. The kids were engaged in the project and thought it was cool.
I had a list of criteria that I set as a way to grade myself on my project. These are a few of my most important ones, and how I felt I did on them.
Design a sturdy trebuchet with minimal flaws using dimensions I created.
 My design had a minimal amount of flaws, and the frame was sturdy enough to survive the violent rocking motions of the trebuchet, and the counterweight box was able to hold 60+ pounds of lead.
The arm, sling, and frame were properly designed to maximize efficiency in the trebuchet, but the counterweight box was not optimized for efficiency.
Build a well made, strong, and efficient trebuchet. 
The trebuchet was strong and well made, but it wasn’t as efficient as I planned. 
The counterweight box didn’t hang as low as it should, so the trebuchet didn’t stall correctly. 
■Stalling is when the arm swings to a certain point, where the counterweight starts moving backward, causing the entire arm to freeze for a split second. 
■The projectile in the sling does not stop. The continued velocity of the projectile is what launches the projectile.
The trebuchet doesn’t stall correctly due to the counterweight box. 
This is fixed by adding length to the wall of the counterweight box.
Build a lego trebuchet that serves as a model of the trebuchet.
I built the lego trebuchet to the proper measurements
However, building a functional sling at that size is extremely difficult.
Because of this, the lego trebuchet does not launch, but accurately models the trebuchet.

The Things They Carried Essay
In The Things They Carried by Tim O’Brien, images of astounding beauty contrast with images of horrific gore. This imagery creates a special tension between the images that really prove O’Brien’s mood of violent tranquility.
A very sudden example of this is in the chapter The Man I Killed, when he says “Along the trail were small blue flowers shaped like bells. The young man’s head was wrenched sideways, not quite facing the flowers…”(O’Brien 121-122). The quick and surprising speed in which these deeply contrasting ideas are presented show not only how horrified O’Brien was to be experiencing these events in Vietnam, but also that O’Brien is blown away by the stunning peace and tranquility of the land itself. And on top of all this is the grief of just having ended a poor man’s life. The passage starts off describing a very beautiful detail of the environment, adds on the morbid reality, and then goes on to intertwine the two. O’Brien does this many times throughout the novel. 
Sometimes, O’Brien highlights the deep contrasts between a gruesome event and a person, as opposed to that of the land. An example of this is in the chapter How to Tell a True War Story, when O’Brien describes Curt Lemon’s face in great detail. He says “... I glanced behind me and watched Lemon step from the shade into the bright sunlight. His face was suddenly bright and shining. A handsome kid, really. Sharp gray eyes, lean and narrow-waisted, and when he died it was almost beautiful, the way the sunlight came around him and lifted him up and sucked him high into a tree full of moss and vines and white blossoms” (67). Even though O’Brien just watched a friend of his get blown to pieces right in front of him, he still vividly remembers how handsome Lemon looked before/during his death. Not only that, but he does not describe Lemon’s death as gruesome or gory, but rather majestic and serene. It seems less like he was blown up by a mine and more like he simply was lifted into a tree, where he was then free. When something traumatic like the death of a fellow soldier happens, there needs to be something that contrasts the gruesome details in order to not only make it bearable, but to make it believable. 
Sometimes the experience does not need to be particularly gory or horrifying to have two strikingly different details. Sometimes it is just a superlative and its opposite. A great example is in the chapter How to Tell a True War Story, when Sanders is telling the story about the listening post. He says “...these guys get themselves deep in the bush… And they lie down and wait… after a couple of days the guys start hearing this real soft, kind of wacked-out music. Weird echos and stuff…”(69). The absolute silence was filled by the strange noises and music they heard. Whether or not the music was actually there does not matter. Because of the uncanny silence, they needed something to counteract the superlative. It seems that a lot of things in Vietnam are very extreme, so in order to make it more bearable, contrasting details are needed. These details are not created, but rather noticed. 
The Things They Carried is a novel of striking contrasts. Be it between the beauty of the land and abhorrent gore, serenity and death, or silence and noise, These contrast show how O’Brien was so stunned by the extremes of the war that his mind notices details of certain events that act as a counter to the horrible things he experienced. This makes these events slightly more believable. ﻿I felt I did pretty well on the math prep I did. While I had to review most of the old content, both this year's content and last year's content, I feel like it took as much time to review the stuff from last year as it did to review the stuff from earlier this year, which was rather short. I also felt that there were a few subjects from last year that I never fully understood, that I now understand fairly well. I know that I will probably have to further review the trigonometry stuff, as that tends to be my weakest point when it comes to math.﻿﻿﻿﻿Trebuchets are THE superior siege engine. I am here today to educate you about the physics of the trebuchet, and what makes them better than catapults. I have built a trebuchet myself, so I know quite a bit about the forces that power the trebuchet.﻿In the novella Of Mice and Men, Lennie is essentially a toddler stuck in a giant's body. He proves time and time again that he is unaware of his own strength. In the text, he says “'I’d pet 'em, and pretty soon, they bit my fingers and I pinched their heads a little and then the was dead’” (Steinbeck 9). Lennie often accidentally hurts or kills things when something happens too fast for him to process. This is often reactionary, not done out of anger. Another example of this is when George and Slim were talking about the incident in Weed. “‘...so he reaches out to feel this red dress an’ the girl squawks and squawks… and he's so god damn strong, you know!’”(39). When Lennie starts freaking out, he shuts down and cannot function. Many people don't understand this and think Lennie is trying to hurt people, when in reality, he never wanted to hurt anyone. The problem is, as George said, is that Lennie is so strong, that it is difficult to get him to stop what he's doing, when he's freaking out. This makes George's job very difficult, because Lennie is always getting in trouble. Throughout the novella, it is quite obvious that Lennie is completely unaware of his own power. This can get Lennie in some very bad situations.﻿ ↑

﻿Research:
My goal was to learn about the physics required to maximize efficiency of the trebuchet, design and build my own trebuchet in a size that could fit in the back of my mom’s car, and teach kids about the physics of trebuchets in order to show them how STEM related subjects are fun.
I chose this project because I love math and physics, and I am intrigued with ancient siege weapons. I always wanted to build an ancient siege weapon, but never got around to it. Samuel C. Florman wrote a book called “The Existential Pleasures of Engineering”, and in it, he wrote “‘doing’ is something more than mere manufacturing. An essential element of the profession of engineering is the concept of creativity”(Florman). This project gave me a reason to build it, and I even got to design it myself. 
I used two very helpful sources to develop the lengths and weights used in my trebuchet, so that I could fine-tune the range of the trebuchet. I then used these measurements to design the actual mechanism. The ratios I learned are as follows:
1.The length of the projectile side of the arm should be 3.75 times longer than the counterweight side of the arm. This is the Beam Ratio.
2.The length of the sling should be the same length as the projectile side of the arm.
3.The initial angle between the counterweight arm and the support should be between 35-45 degrees at launch.
4.The Mass Ratio of the Counterweight to the Projectile is the Beam Ratio times 20 
Criteria:
1. I will build a fully functioning Trebuchet
2. I will provide pictures of the class I teach
3. I will evaluate my Google Drawings of Trebuchet design that I created
4. I will make Lego prototype to show that I know how to actually design a trebuchet in any size.

﻿While grading the Paper 2 I was given, I realized that there are many different possible interperetations to a poem. The Paper 1 I graded was not necessarily better or worse than mine, but it presented a wildly different argument than mine; one that presented equally valid points and provided sufficient evidence to back up those claims. I do not agree with their claims, but I can understand their argument. As such, I have learned that it is very important to consider every position when analyzing something as intentionally vague as a poem.﻿﻿ Have you ever been sitting at your desk, wondering what's missing?

whether she ought to meet him today. Her heart immediately answered, "Yes," but she felt 
obstinately, "No, he must first come back to the cafe." And so she refrained from going out at 
her usual time. She crouched behind her window waiting to see what would happen.
The sun set and night spread its wings. Soon she saw the man coming up the alley, his 
eyes fixed on the gap in the shutters of her window. On his face she could see a slight smile of 
resignation as he sat in his usual chair. As she watched him she felt the delights of victory and 
revenge for the way he had punished her by appearing unexpectedly in Mousky. Their eyes met 
and stayed fixed on one another for a long time. She neither looked away nor moved. His smile 
broadened and she smiled too, although she was unaware that she did. What could he want? 
The question seemed idle to her, for she could see only one reason for his continuous pursuit of 
her. The same thing that Abbas wanted earlier and Salim Alwan too before fate struck him 
down. Why shouldn't this fine young man be after the same goal? Why else would he say, 
"Aren't you on this earth to be taken? And I'm just the one to take you!" What could this 
possibly mean if not marriage? There seemed to be no obstacle in the way of her dreams, for 
her ungovernable vanity gave her a feeling of power and enormous self-confidence. So she 
remained looking out at him from behind the shutters, returning his intense looks without 
shyness or hesitation. His eyes spoke to her with depth and feeling, sharpening all her senses 
and igniting all her instincts. Perhaps it was this strange and deep feeling that she had 
experienced without even knowing it when their eyes met that first time and he smiled at her 
victoriously. She was drawn to him as she had always been drawn by a challenge to battle. The 
truth was that his eyes revealed a great deal of herself. She had always wandered aimlessly 
through life and her confusion persisted before Abbas' humble gaze and the great wealth of 
Salim Alwan. She felt, however, that this man had been searching for her, and this excitement 
and attraction drew her nearer to him. She felt drawn like the needle of a compass to the poles. 
She also knew that he was not just a penniless beggar who would make her endure want and 
poverty; his appearance and his bank notes proved that. Her eyes remained fixed on him, 
reflecting desire and delight. She did not move from her position until he left the cafe, bidding 
her goodbye with a faint smile. Her eyes followed him as he went down the alley and she 
murmured as though in farewell, "Tomorrow."
On the following afternoon she left the house, her heart filled with anticipation, desire 
for battle, and delight with life. She had scarcely left Sanadiqiya Street when she saw him 
standing some distance away at the junction of Ghouriya and New Street. A light gleamed in 
her eyes and she felt strange, obscure sensations stirring within her, that mixture of pleasure and 
a bestial desire to fight. She imagined he would follow her when she passed him until they were 
alone together in Darasa Street. So she went slowly on, feeling no anxiety or shyness, and 
approached him as though she had not noticed he was there. However, as she passed him 
something completely unexpected happened. He walked beside her and, with indescribable 
boldness, stretched out his arm and gripped her hand. Paying no attention to the people walking 
by or standing about, he said quietly, "Good evening, my darling."
She was taken unaware and tried vainly to release her hand but was afraid if she tried 
again she would attract too much attention and so she boiled with frustration. She was in a 
dilemma. If she were to release her anger, there would be a disgraceful scandal and the whole

forced himself upon her and defeated her. Fury filled her as she hissed, trembling with emotion,

Our product is a bar of soap, shaped like Michigan. Inside, is a box that can contain one of six things: a $1 bill, a $5 bill, a $8 Petoskey Stone, a $10 bill, a $20 bill, or a $50 bill. These are the probabilities:
$1
.4 or 40%
$5
.2 or 20%
$8 Petoskey Stone
.15 or 15%
$10
.15 or 15%
$20
.05 or 5%
$50
.05 or 5%
Our expected payout is $7.60. This is the average amount that we will pay out per bar of soap.
1(.4) + 5(.2) + 8(.15) + 10(.15) + 20(.05) + 50(.05) = 7.6 or $7.60
We will charge $10 for the soap. That way we make a lot more money per bar of soap than what we expect to pay out. We determined this by taking the expected payout and just adding a bit to it in order to make a profit. We also chose $10 because it is equal to the dollar amount given out by the middle prize (the $10 bill). We expect to earn roughly $2.40 from each bar of soap. Even though some bars will have more than $10 in them, the other ones with less money will balance the loss out.
10 - 7.6 = 2.4 or $2.40
Since our soap is shaped like michigan, we will be selling it in tourist gift shops in cities such as Petoskey, Mackinaw City, Harbor Springs, Traverse City, etc. Michigan-themed products sell very well to tourists in those cities, so our product will do well there.
A probability simulation can be set up by taking the probabilities of each prize and representing them by a range of numbers. For this simulation, the following are the probabilities:
$1 bill: 1-40
$5 bill: 41-60
$8 Petoskey Stone: 61-75
$10 bill: 76-90
$20 bill: 91-95
$50 bill: 96-100

Overall, we made 10 * 30, which is $300.
We lost $331 overall, which resulted in a loss of $31. 
20+20+1+5+5+8+1+1+50+1+10+50+1+1+1+20+1+1+5+10+50+1+1+1+1+8+1+5+1+50 = $331
331/30= $11.03
Our simulated average payout was $11.03, while the predicted payout was $7.60. This resulted in a difference of $3.43.
11.03 - 7.6 = $3.43
We expected to make an average of $2.40 in profits from the soap, but instead, we lost an average of $1.03 per bar of soap. 
11.03-10 = $1.03
The reason why these values are wildly different is because we only did 30 trials. The difference between the decided probabilities of each outcome and the probabilities if one calculated them using the data from the trial, they are very different.
We think that the simulated average profit does not represent the situation well enough, because we expect to sell much more than just 30 bars of soap. With lots of trials, the amount of profit per bar of soap will slowly come out to be around $2.40 per bar. ﻿I found this to be much easier than expected. A majority of the difficult content of physics was all in this year, so it was still relatively fresh in my memory. I know i need to work on subjects like rotational mechanics and astronomy, but I feel very good about where I am at with physics in terms of the IB exams. With the school cancellation, I will have much more time to work on all of my subjects, but I can rest easy knowing that I can focus nore on the other subjects that I struggle with more, such as chemistry and math. I did this assignment without distraction, and it took much less time than i expected, less than the chemistry exam prep assignment that I did last week. I listened to music and got the whole thing done in one sitting, as music really helps me focus and power through just about any assignment or project.﻿Name: Asher Ashenclaw
Strengths/Things you did well:
I picked a very interesting topic, one that interested me. While I hit some road bumps in the beginning, I was able to craft a very good essay. Also, my analysis was entirely original, and the specific arguments I made in the essay are ones that might not have ever been made before. 
Challenges you encountered:
My initial rough draft was of very poor quality. Despite being a data-based essay, it contained almost no data. the data it did contain was mostly irrelevant to the analysis I was doing, and some parts of the essay were lacking. I found out about all of this about 2 weeks from the final due date, so I had a very short period of time to completely overhaul my draft. 
How did you overcome these challenges?
After realizing the state my draft was in, I realized that I needed to act fast. That weekend, I went to the cabin my family owns, and scoured the internet for relevant data on my topic, until I found three Master’s theses from three different people from the same college in Sweden. I then went up again the weekend after that and finished the essay in the cabin. 
What are you most proud of when you reflect on the extended essay and your work?
When I received my draft and learned of its problems, I was initially crushed. I was then able to pull myself out of this rut and create something I am really proud of. The day after the due date, I was not proud of the finished product, but I have slowly realized that I produced something truly remarkable, especially in such a short period of time.
Anything else you want me to add to the comments?
Capitalize the fact that my draft was in super rough shape at one point.﻿https://docs.google.com/document/d/[REDACTED]/edit?usp=sharing﻿
This essay will seek to answer the question: What are some possible methods of clean-up for PFAS contaminated water supplies in Michigan? This essay will compare different methods of PFAS removal and cleanup, and discuss possible solutions for sites labeled as contaminated by the MDEGLE. This topic is worthy of discussion because PFAS can affect anyone who uses tap water, and while getting some publicity in recent years, is not discussed as much as it should be.
I went about my research through digital means. This is due to the fact that PFAS was relatively unheard of until recently. There are very few paper sources on PFAS, and many data sources, scientific reports, and journals on this topic can be found online. The scope of my investigation focuses on Michigan, but the methods of PFAS removal discussed within are applicable anywhere PFAS is an issue, and the data sources relating to the efficacy of certain methods are not local. My main data source is actually three master’s theses from three different people, all from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. Each contained data on the efficacy of treatment methods that proved invaluable in this essay. Another source I used a lot was a list of locations designated by the MDEGLE as PFAS sites. In this essay, I discussed the different methods of treatment for PFAS chemicals, discussed their strengths and weaknesses, and presented data on their efficacy. I then selected a few sites from the list of PFAS sites and suggested possible cleanup methods the chosen sites. The use of PFAS began in 1947, and was used as a surfactant in the process of developing waterproof and non-stick cookware. Nowadays, it is still used as a surfactant, but it is also “used in fire retardants, oil and water repellents, furniture, waterproof clothes, take out containers and non-stick cookware” (Scialla). PFAS chemicals have been the subject of numerous studies, most of which found PFAS chemicals to be carcinogens and persistent in the environment and human body. Recently, PFAS chemicals have been discovered in water sources around Michigan. The EPA has set a limit of 70 ppt that applies only to PFOS and PFOA, but there are PFAS types other than PFOS and PFOA. Military bases are a common source of PFAS pollution in Michigan, due to its use in AFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Foam), which is commonly used in fire extinguishers. As for civilian contamination, it can occur from the degradation of products containing PFAS inside landfills, or from a wide variety of other sources.
While all PFAS has been shown to be dangerous to human health and the environment, it is important to note that not all PFAS react the same to treatment. The main difference between the different types of PFAS is the length of the carbon chain. This can vary from as few as 3 carbons to as many as 13 carbons.. Some treatments are not very effective at the removal of short chain PFAS, while others excel at removing them. The data analyzed in this essay uses the chain length as the horizontal axis, which is done to show how the removal efficacy is dependent on it. The vertical axes in the graphs is the percentage of PFAS removal, out of 100%. When compared to the data of other trials, the three data sets used here seem to give lower values, around 10-40% less than other trials. This may be due to the fact that desorption was common in the experiments. Additionally, the data suggests that the removal percent for short chain PFAS is lower with AIX than it is with GAC, which is contrary to the findings of most other studies. Nonetheless, the data still represents the trend of both GAC and AIX, illustrating the fact that short chain PFAS is best dealt with by other treatment methods. The data for HPMS is one data set, which was taken from the EPA Water Treatability Database. The data presented there are not the results of any one test, but rather the average of a number of tests. Again, using the chain length as the X axis and the removal percent as the Y axis, the graph for HPMS shows its efficacy at removing both short and long chain PFAS.
Granular activated carbon, or GAC, for short, is one of the most well-researched methods of organic contaminant adsorption. The process involves the attraction of PFAS due to its high polarity at the head of the molecule. GAC generally is comprised of coal or coconut, and adsorbs molecules very efficiently due to its “large surface area to which contaminants may adsorb” (EPA). GAC can be used in “any aqueous-based treatment application (for example, municipal drinking water, groundwater, point-of-use residential, industrial wastewater, and landfill leachate)” (Mueller). It is relatively cheap to install, but it must be regularly replaced or it may begin to desorb. It has been shown to have a removal rate for long-chain PFAS of around 90%, with much lower removal rates for short chain PFAS (Hansen Et al.). This is because shorter chain PFAS fills up the surface area of the carbon much quicker than longer chain PFAS, oversaturating it and causing it to desorb. As mentioned in my data sources, this caused the removal rate to go into the negative percents as PFAS desorbed back into the water. This desorption heavily affects the uncertainty values of the graph, making them seem much lower than what has since been established.
GAC is quite versatile, which is partially why it is used so often to clean up organic contaminants. It can be placed directly in contaminated water sources or used in Point of Use (POU) systems along with RO filters in the pipes of a home or in the head of a sink or tap. The production of GAC slightly increases the carbon footprint due to the energy needed to produce it, but the main impact relates to its disposal after it is spent. GAC can either be regenerated to be used again, or it can be incinerated. Incineration increases the carbon footprint, but regeneration allows the reuse of the media. While it has been shown that virgin GAC and reused GAC perform about the same, “virgin material achieves greater confidence in treatment” (Mueller). Reused GAC should be used more often in order to reduce the carbon footprint, so that less GAC is incinerated.
Another possible treatment for contaminated water is with anion exchange resins, or AIX for short. They function very similarly to GAC, removing PFAS by attracting the negative “head” of the PFAS molecule to the positively charged anion resin, and thus the two are commonly compared to each other. AIX can be used in POU systems as well as entire water supplies, but function better when high concentrations of PFAS are present. AIX has also been shown to remove PFAS faster than GAC, and has been proven to adsorb short chain PFAS better than GAC, with the exception of PFBA, a molecule that both treatment methods struggle with (Chiang Et al.), but the data used does not reflect this. This drop in the removal percentage was observed across all three data sources for both GAC and AIX, and since AIX is known to adsorb much quicker than GAC, it could have reached the critical saturation point much sooner than GAC, giving it more time to desorb. A disposable version of AIX has been tested and may solve the issue of removing shorter chain PFAS. As it currently stands, AIX is more expensive to use than GAC, and if a disposable version of AIX was perfected, then the lower cost of the AIX would make up for the shorter lifespan.
As far as sustainability is concerned, AIX also can either be regenerated or incinerated. The production of AIX increases the carbon footprint, and while incineration of AIX does as well, the regeneration of AIX produces highly contaminated wastewater that must be disposed of, and “Disposal or treatment of the regenerant stream can be problematic and expensive” (Mueller). Additionally, if AIX is not regenerated properly, it can start releasing the previously adsorbed PFAS.
High-Pressure Membrane Separation (HPMS) is generally used to describe two different kinds of filters: Nanofilters (NF), which function similar to normal mesh filters, with holes 1 nm across, and reverse osmosis filters (RO), which work by pressurizing contaminated water and filtering it with a permeable membrane. The difference between the two is slight, but important. While an RO filter will remove all molecules in water, they also remove any minerals and hardness in the water, whereas NF will still let mineral ions to pass through. Regardless, they both have a very high PFAS removal rate of around 99% for most types of PFAs, including shorter chain PFAS, which the data supports. When HPMS filters are used, they create a small stream of highly contaminated sludge water that must be disposed of. They are also rather expensive, but can be used in POU systems and in pipes. It is worth pointing out that GAC and AIX are more effective at removing PFAS from water with high concentrations of it, which, as Klara Lindegren points out, ”To decontaminate the reject water, adsorption by [GAC] or anion exchange [] have been proposed” (Lindegren). The Minnesota Department of Health also did some testing on POU RO filters that take advantage of this property of GAC and AIX. Their tests involved a “reverse-osmosis device [with] a carbon prefilter and [] postfilter ("polishing filter")” (MDH). The test results returned that “All RO devices removed PFCs to below reporting limits of 0.2 µg/L” (MDH), and that “The effectiveness of RO devices is due, in part, to these devices having both AC and RO components” (MDH). One common issue with most HPMS filters is that the hardness of the water tends to build up on the surface of the filter, causing flow blockages. Commonly referred to as ‘scaling’, there are some filter designs that account for this problem and mitigate it. One such design uses a “loose, negatively charged nanofiltration (NF) membrane with tailored selectivity for the removal of [PFAS] with reduced scaling potential” (Boo, Et al.). This means that the surface of the filter rejects all organic contaminants while still allowing mineral ions to pass through. As for the sustainability of HPMS filters, both treatment methods create a stream of waste that must be disposed of. RO filters without the anti-scaling design in particular present the issue of removing metal ions as well as contaminants, creating a waste stream that is both toxic and corrosive. If not disposed of properly this wastewater stream can be very problematic. Also, RO filters require constant power, as the water must be pressurized in order to pass through the filter (Mueller). 
If soil is contaminated and a simple solution is needed, capping may be an option. Capping is essentially encasing the contaminated soil in a large concrete container, trapping the source of the PFAS contamination inside. While it technically does not remove the contamination, it prevents the contamination from spreading, if done correctly. It requires occasional maintenance, and the surrounding area should be regularly tested to make sure nothing is leaking. Capping is best suited for sites that are abandoned or decommissioned. It is also important to note that “Caps are most effective when the seasonal high-water table is well separated vertically from the base of the contaminated solids” (Mueller). If groundwater is too close to the bottom of the cap, then PFAS leakage can occur. There is not likely going to be any available data on the efficacy of capping, as the method does not involve actual chemical processes. One downside of capping is that it severely limits the options for redevelopment of the site. The sustainability concerns of capping revolves mainly around the emissions/energy used during the construction of the cap. The cap can be specifically designed to mitigate the impact on the surrounding ecosystem, and if the impact from the construction vehicles could negatively impact the ecosystem, then perhaps a different treatment would be better suited for that particular site.
Another possible cleanup method is called excavation and disposal, or ED. It works by removing all of the contaminated soil and replacing it with uncontaminated soil. The contaminated dirt is then disposed of in a concrete-lined landfill, treated with other removal techniques, or incinerated. This method could be useful for contaminated sites that are still in use or operation, as it does not limit the options for redevelopment. It is slightly more costly, but requires no upkeep other than regular testing to assure that the treatment was successful. This method also does not lend itself to quantitative data as it should remove all PFAS if done correctly. This treatment leaves a carbon footprint from the emissions caused by the construction equipment, the transportation of both the contaminated and uncontaminated dirt, and the disposal of the contaminated soil. If it is disposed of in a landfill, then further contamination could occur at the new location if the landfill is not properly lined to prevent landfill leaching. Also, “Landfill incineration of the contaminated soil is energy intensive” (Mueller). The ecosystem could also potentially be disturbed by the excavation process. When dealing with a contaminated site, the surrounding ecosystem should be considered when deciding whether or not to utilize ED.
A third possible treatment for contaminated soil or ground is through sorption and stabilization. This process can utilize a wide variety of media, but it works the same way regardless of the medium. Sorption and stabilization is essentially “Amendments added to the soil [in order to] reduce or remove the potential for PFAS to mobilize from soil to groundwater” (Mueller). Some possible amendments include GAC, AIX, carbon nanotubes, biomaterials, minerals, or molecularly imprinted polymers. With carbon-based media, it was found that the media was very effective at removing longer chain PFAS, but again fell short when exposed to shorter chain PFAS. There are other non carbon-based sorption media that could be used if the PFAS contamination is found to be mainly short chain. This method may be the best option for places that need treatment but would be negatively affected if the dirt was removed. While it is considered a different method from GAC and AIX, its efficacy is about the same. The impact of sorption and stabilization on the surrounding ecosystem includes the emissions of the equipment used to implement the treatment, and from the transportation equipment that delivers the media. Additionally, the impact of the construction equipment should be considered, but the negative impact on the ecosystem would be much less than capping or ED.
There are quite a few PFAS contaminated sites around Michigan, each with different origins and conditions. As such, they each must be treated differently. The best treatment for a site is entirely dependent on the cause of the pollution, the current conditions of the area, the relative levels of PFAS, the levels of other organic and inorganic molecules, and other factors. While some of these factors are not easily accessible, there is enough data to make suggestions on what methods might work and what methods might not. 
One contaminated site in Michigan is the area in and around Camp Grayling. A military base in the middle of the northern part of the state, it has likely been contaminated with PFAS from military operations relating to the extinguishing of fires using AFFF. As such, the pollution is most likely of the groundwater, and of the ground itself. While the township water supply only came in with a reading of 3 ppt, most of the sites tested returned no levels of PFAS. The source of the contamination is probably a specific location on site that has an extremely high level of PFAS. As for the contaminated area itself, SInce Camp Grayling is still in use today, capping is likely not the most viable option. Since the source of the contamination is likely AFFF, long chain PFAS are likely going to be the only contaminants. This means GAC and AIX could work. Since it is a Military base, accessing it with construction equipment should not be an issue, so it may be cheaper and more effective to utilize ED. Until the regular testing for PFAS on base drops below a safe threshold, all water supplies on and near the base should be fitted with an HPMS filter with GAC or AIX support.
Another military base worthy of discussion is K. I. Sawyer AFB. It is also contaminated with PFAS at extremely high levels in some places. The difference between Camp Grayling and this base is that K. I. Sawyer was decommissioned 24 years ago. A portion of the base is now used as a county airport, but most of it is unused. Around the base are 15 known locations of PFAS contamination, a majority of which are the result of improper AFFF disposal or contamination from its use. Tests for PFAS returned very high levels of PFOS, PFOA and PFBS in most of the 15 sites. Local wells were also sampled and found to contain elevated levels of PFAS (AFCEC). Capping may be a viable option to begin with, but the groundwater patterns must be taken into account. ED would also be a good option, as it would require no upkeep other than regular testing to assure all contaminated soil was removed. Sorption and stabilization could be implemented, but since the base is decommissioned, it would likely be cheaper to utilize a different method. The surrounding community should be equipped with HPMS filters, and the river nearby should be closely monitored. 
Another contaminated site is Adams Plating. Located at 521 N Rosemary in Lansing, it was designated as a Superfund site in 1993 after it was found to be polluting the surrounding area with various heavy metals, namely chromium. Prior to 1964 the building was “a dry cleaning business that stored dry cleaning fluid in a 500-gallon underground storage tank []. The tank was removed in the 1950s, reportedly due to leaking” (EPA). The electroplating operation opened in 1964 and closed down in the 1980s, and was then designated as a superfund in 1993. In 2010, the building caught fire and was destroyed, which released more harmful chemicals. The site was then cleaned up once again in order to prevent more pollution. Capping was implemented in order to prevent the contamination of heavy metals, but it has also worked so far for PFAS. The two water supply tests in lansing both returned no detectable amount of PFOS or PFOA, but the surrounding houses should be supplied with POU HPMS filters as an additional safety measure.
Another interesting site is the Parchment city water supply. It was found to have a PFAS level of 1,828 ppt, 26 times the EPA suggested limit of 70 ppt. While the causes are still being investigated, the city has decided to temporarily fix the problem by switching to Kalamazoo’s water supply. However, Kalamazoo was found to have a PFAS level of 72 ppt, which is still above the EPA limit. For both of the cities, HPMS filters should be implemented in both the main water supply. It may not be a good idea to put HPMS filters in all of the homes, as that would be very expensive. Once the source of the PFAS is identified, the area should either use ED or be treated with sorption and stabilization, depending on the source. If the source is found to be an abandoned site, then capping may be the best option. If the source is near any houses, the houses should be sampled, and provided HPMS filters if necessary.
Many of the PFAS sites on the list are landfills. Most normal landfills are lined, meaning they have been surrounded with concrete to prevent the leaching of chemicals into the groundwater. Landfills marked as PFAS sites are most likely unlined, as a PFAS contaminated landfill is not a problem if there is no leaching. A majority of PFAS contamination in landfills are not the result of poorly executed ED, but rather the degradation of products or equipment that contains PFAS. If PFAS contamination in a particular landfill is especially bad, then a full capping is the best option. If the landfill is still in use, or it cannot be capped for some reason, then sorption and stabilization may be the only viable option. 
One final site worth discussing is Robinson Elementary School, in Grand Haven. It was tested for PFAS and was found to be higher than the 70 ppt limit. In response, the school stopped using the faucets and supplies students with bottled water (Center). During the investigation, “the [MDEGLE] explored whether this could have been caused by the use of AFFF foam” (Center). It was found that AFFF was most likely the cause of contamination, as it was also found near the fire department. Homes and businesses nearby were “‘offered and provided [POU] filtration systems for in their kitchen’” (Center). As for the school itself, capping is unlikely to be a viable solution, as Robinson Elementary is still used today. The best solution for the problem would either be ED or sorption and stabilization. Additionally, some sort of filter should be used in the pipes of the school. An HPMS filter with GAC or AIX would work well, as AFFF tends to contain mainly long chain PFAS.
There are many other PFAS sites in Michigan, but most resemble one of the aforementioned situations and could be solved using the suggested methods. To recapitulate, those methods are GAC, which works best in aqueous situations and could be used almost anywhere, but work better when used with HPMS filters. AIX was discussed as a slightly more efficient, albeit more costly alternative to GAC, which cannot adsorb shorter chain PFAS quite as easily. HPMS filters such as NF and RO filters were considered, especially for their ability to filter out short chain PFAS, and how they work better in conjunction with GAC or AIX, with the downside of being more expensive. Capping was discussed, which is essentially encasing the contaminated soil in concrete. It is effective, but limits options for redevelopment in the previously contaminated area and does not actually remove the PFAS. It is a rather cheap solution that requires some maintenance and works well for abandoned or decommissioned sites. ED was also analyzed, which involves removing all of the contaminated dirt and replacing it with uncontaminated soil, and then either treating or disposing of the contaminated dirt in a lined landfill. This method works well for sites that are still in use and cannot work with the limitations imposed by capping. Sorption and Stabilization was the final solid treatment discussed. It consisted of taking a sorption media and applying it directly to the contaminated area. This method would also work best in areas that are still in use but cannot be easily accessed by construction vehicles, but is more expensive.
Many different Michigan PFAS sites were discussed, and suggestions for cleanup methods were given. Both Camp Grayling and K. I. Sawyer AFB were discussed. Also discussed was Adams Plating, a superfund that used capping to prevent chromium contamination, which has worked quite well so far. The treatment for unlined landfills were discussed, as well as the reason for their contamination. Parchment and Kalamazoo were discussed, and how Parchment had an astronomically high PFAS level of 1,828 ppt, while Kalamazoo only had 72 ppt, both of which are above the limit of 70 ppt. Lastly, Robinson Elementary was discussed, with how it got contaminated in the first place and how it could be fixed. More could be done about PFAS in research and in the cleanup of contaminated sites. PFAS is not yet fully understood, and only with further research into the chemicals themselves and into possible treatments can we protect the people and environment of Michigan and the world from these persistent and toxic chemicals.﻿Written Assignment Research Sheet

Lead is an element, number 82 on the periodic table. It is very dense, has a relatively low melting point, and is very malleable, properties that it shares with metals near it on the periodic table. This group of dense, malleable metals with low melting points are dubbed “heavy metals”. Other heavy metals include bismuth, cadmium, mercury, and tin.
Lead has adverse effects on many parts of the human body, such as the kidneys, heart, reproductive organs, and nervous system. Lead poisoning affects the brain the most, and studies show that a country’s lead contamination levels correlate with violent crime rate trends. 
The main way that lead interferes with bodily functions is through enzyme inhibitions, particularly of the sulfhydryl groups that it binds to, which are found on a variety of enzymes. This is due to the fact that thiol groups act as lewis bases, with the metal ions acting as lewis acids. These form very stable compounds, which make them difficult to reverse. This often means that when lead (or any other transition metal) bonds to an enzyme in this manner, it is permanent.
Lead exposure occurs primarily in two ways: ingestion and inhalation. Ingestion usually occurs through contact with inorganic lead, usually found in consumer products such as bullets, fishing weights, paint, and solder, and through consumption of lead-contaminated water. While in recent years, governmental regulations severely limit the use of lead in consumer products, many products still exist that were manufactured before these regulations were implemented. 
Inhalation of lead occurs when there is lead pollution in the air. By far the largest polluter of lead in recent history was the use of leaded gasoline in cars from the 1930s to the 1960s. Leaded gasoline contains Tetraethyllead, an additive that was used to prevent engine knocking, improving fuel economy. When tetraethyl lead is combusted, it produces lead-containing compounds which are flushed into the air in the exhaust of the car.
There are many alternatives to lead that are available. Lead fishing weights have been replaced with tungsten, an element with a similar density and price, electrical solder, while still containing a small amount of lead, is significantly less dangerous, and Galinstan, a proprietary alloy of gallium, indium and tin can be used as a lead-free solder used in plumbing.
1 She felt it was a liberation, allowing her to break free from the authorities and rebel. She cites the ancient legend of the Monkey King, who was imprisoned for 500 years under a mountain.

3 Yang uses literary techniques that she learned from her teacher to write a dazibao against her.
4 Part of the previous culture around teachers and other authority figures was a sense that they were justified in all that they did.

9 The Great Leap Forward was a disastrous social program made by Mao in order to try and reignite a stagnating China and modernise it. It failed, and caused the most massive man-made famine in all of human history. After its catastrophic failure, Mao started the cultural revolution, leading to one of the most bloody revolutions ever.
10 Nowadays, the CCP wants the view of the Cultural Revolution to be no view at all. Government censorship is massive in China, and all references to the cultural revolution are blocked.
