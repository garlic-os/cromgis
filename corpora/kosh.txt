Greetings, Commander.
They are alone. They are a dying race. We should let them pass.
I am studying.
I wish to engage your services.
All arranged, as is payment. We will meet in Red 3 at the hour of scampering.
Understanding is a three-edged sword.
Please scan Abbut. Report to me his thoughts at present.
Excellent. We may now begin our business. Abbut?
Then the willows must scuttle carefully.
The talks are over for the day. We shall commence again tomorrow at the hour of longing.
There is a question?
Ah, you seek meaning. Then listen to the music, not the song.
Your belief does not enter into it. We have a contract.
What is need compared to the path?
A stroke of the brush does not guarantee art from the bristles. Do you understand, Miss Winters?
Reflection, surprise, terror. For the future.
You are not ready for immortality.
The avalanche has already started. It is too late for the pebbles to vote.
Leave this place. They are not for you. Go. Leave. Now.
And so it begins. You have forgotten something.
In fire.
We were never away. For the first time your mind is quiet enough to hear me.
You have always been here.
I sought understanding. I listen to the song. Your thoughts became the song.
You wanted to see me.
They are not ready. They would not understand.
No. You do not even understand yourself.
Can you help me to understand you?
No. You do not understand. Go.
Never ask that question.
I will teach you.
About you. Until you are ready.
To fight legends.
The lesson.
Precisely the correct time. Come.
Good... What is this place?
One moment of perfect beauty.
If you go to Ooer, you will die.
You, perhaps. We have sent for an Inquisitor.
To be sure about you. You will submit to his authority.
You will know, if you survive.
Being seen by so many at once was a great strain. I returned to my ship to rest. You have a question?
It was necessary.
I have always been here.
Yes. Formality. Ritual. You should be informed.
It is enough.
Just us.
I am who I have always been.
Perhaps. But there are still few of us. It is not our time. It is yours. We are not prepared yet.
Impudent.
Incorrect.
Disobedient.
It is not yet time.
I will do as you ask. But there is a price to pay. I will not be there to help you when you go to Ooer.
Yes. Now.
You do not understand. But you will.
I don't have much time, son. I want you to know you were right. I didn't want to admit that. Just pride I guess. You get my age, you get kinda set in your ways. It had to be done. Don't blame yourself for what happened later.
It's too late for me. I'm sorry for what I did before. I knew what was ahead. I guess -- I guess I was afraid. When you've lived as long as I have, you -- you get kinda used to it. Ah! I wish I could have done more for you. There's so much I should have said, and now it's too late.
You're right. It's time you begin fighting this war your way.
It's -- it's all right, son. See, as long as you're here, I'll always be here.
We are all Kosh.
There was no other?
And so it begins.
Jump. Jump now.
When the long night comes, return to the end of the beginning.
